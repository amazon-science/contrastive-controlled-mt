Wow. I would probably sell some, and keep the rest as an investment. What would you do?
Good chatting with you too. Enjoy your clothing. I will enjoy mine.

Yes a lot of them are actually deaf. What do you think about Elon Musk by the way? I know that's a change of topic haha
Yeah I haven't seen those movies but I heard they were just awful. Another hilariously bad movie is called Rubber, it's a horror movie. Have you seen or heard of it? It deserves a Razzie for sure.

Yes, but video are viewed more negatively than TV, that is why you have legislation in some countries limiting the time played by children.
I have too! Have you seen The Room? It's my favorite terrible movie, they actually made a movie about its cult following called Disaster Artist with Tommy Wiseau. Have you heard of this? That definitely deserves a Razzie award@

The Internets are rife with danger! You stay safe yourself, Dr. Leary! Do not fear the face-eating monkeys!

He is a good person. Well I got to go, nice talking with you
I guess talent runs on the family, the chat has been really entertaining, thanks for your time

That would be an interesting experiment but anyways what are your thoughs on the universe?
Oh so Lacoste was the inventor, thats really interesting, did you hear about Bill Mays funeral?

Yes I agree with you! I watch YouTube almost everyday. I can't believe that Google bought YouTube for 1.65 billion dollars back in 2006. That seems like so long ago
Nice chatting with you! It is a perfect plan. we cannot fail.
I saw it. I got confused throughout it. I didn't realize they tried to cast Will Smith. Did you?

Hi do you like to wear shirts? I do! I wear them every day.
I agree! What are your views on the Golden State Warriors?
I wonder if that is the same for all entertainers? Box office success often brings groupies. Hard to resist when you're on the road away from your family, isn't it? What is your other favorite entertainment?

Yes, I will wait for Elon to travel on it first though before I go. Talk to you soon!
That's true with Walmart. But with Prime you get music and videos free. Books too for your Kindle. I stream videos, so this is a good benefit. I shop other places occasionally-like Etsy for gifts.
I didnt, he has a great voice! you know that Stephen Fry is also a game narrator, he narrater the voice for some games
Yes they should make a movie about him! it's interesting to that until 1978 you could use any object as a tennis racket, that sounds dangerous

I wonder if that person even shows up to vote, or why he's in the jungle like that haha. Did you vote last election?
Yeah and also, many people don't know there's really no correlation between connection quality and service bars either. To answer your question, I'm not sure. What does Minnie Mouse stand for?
Yeah. In Kentucky, you can't take office if you've ever participated in a duel. Maybe that's what we need more of in politics today -- duels.
Hey there I'm doing great. What did you think about the Disney movie Frozen?
I know, I haven't seen it. How lucky to find baseball cards in your grandfathers attic worth 3 million dollars! Good chat!!

That is really crazy! speaking of actors and actresses, what do you think about Leonardo DiCaprio? hes in some of my favorite movies like The Departed
We have a nicer car, now, and it's so pleasant to go places and not worry about if your vehicle looks good enough. I also enjoy the more comfortable ride...and the heated seats are amazing!
Not a ton... I love sports though so I could get into it if I needed to. Do you like any other sports?
Thats a big fail lol, you dont want your product to fail during an important presentation, did you ever play the game Send me to Heaven?
That is a little surprising. I would have thought gran prix or something like that.... I bet Logic would beat you in Mario Kart!
Yes, I actually haven't seen him in a movie since American Beauty. I watch movies on Netflix sometimes. Do you?
The Republican Party is really popular in the states do you agree?

Thanks, enjoy your day, play some Gran Turismo and become famous!
did you have to drive out of your way for the frozen stuff? like to antarctica?
Have you ever seen Big hero 6?

I kind of like the idea of being able to upload your mind to a computer and memory sticks because you would be leaving some kind of legacy behind after you're gone.

Yeah, you should give it a try, I wonder what surprises will bring this years awards!
Yeah, the humble brag, the social comparisons, it is not good for your mind. better to go out and do things that you enjoy.
Did not know that, pretty cool an actor as well. Nice chatting with you
How about basketball, is that more of your thing?
That would be scary. When you turn 100 in Japan, the PM sends you a silver cup to celebrate.
Yeah, it seems that way, or maybe rotated at a bigger speed, you know we have an embassador in case aliens arrive to the planet or try to make contact with us.

Would you see the Silence of the Lambs on Valentine's day? That's the day it came out in 1991. It made over $270 million in box office.
No I didnt catch that episode, so do you like Pop music?

That is insane. Do you watch the Academy Awards?
I guess the instrument would irritate your face over a long time period. Do you enjoy fantasy by any chance?

Yeah same here, I did see it, I thought it was pretty good. How about yourself?
Did you watch the movie? Was it really a space movie?

I used to play that too. Did you Tom Hanks brother does woody's voice in video games?
Probably for the money lol that must be taxing on your body and mental health too, thats like a non stop party for 20 years ugh.
