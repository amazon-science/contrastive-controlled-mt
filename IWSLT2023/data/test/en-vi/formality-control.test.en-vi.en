I always like the TZ. Did you see the movie The Revenant?   It was a 1971 film of wilderness survival.  Leo did a great job.
That's a good point! Scary thing about our current trajectory is that Earth will be out of helium by the year 2100, I know that you love him very important for manufacturing things so I don't know what we'll do
Yep I agree it seems stupid. I don't know why they need to play on grass specifically, did you hear about the longest tennis point of all time?

It used to be my nickname!  Not because I am as old as Shakespeare... since he was alive during the time of Pocahontas, which is a little older than I. What's your take on SHakespeare?

Really?  Which ones did that?  Seems like you always hear of big names rejecting parts and then finding out the movies do fantastic.

That is amazing, great actor! good chatting with you!
I like baseball, but I don't really have a favorite team. Do you?
no, i dont. i would like to go back and visit countries in europe to see where my ancestors came from. it is interesting to trace your roots.
Wow, that is a long time to take to write a script. Well, nice chatting with you!
Wow that is hard to believe although I have been on that ride and it is so much fun. The dinosaurs in Jurassic Park only appear in the film for 15 minutes surprisingly. It was nice talking with you today.
You are correct about that. There's big money in test, treatments,and medications. Well, I know what I'm having for dinner now, either cajun stuffed flounder or blackened Mahi. What's your favorite fish to eat?
That sounds delicious, is that your favorite omelet?
Yeah absolutely, regardless it will be cool to see if Netflix can makea similar show themselves after Game of Thrones ends. Anyways it was nice chatting with you, have a good day!
It's really interesting. So with your sciatic nerve removed, have you lost a lot of motor function?
I didn't like the show as well, I loved Seinfeld and Frasier, never really watched Friends until the reruns started playing.  My favorite show on tv is Criminal Minds, what is your favorite TV show?
Oh I didn't know that. Have you seen that movie is it any good?
Nice, that is cool. Do you like dogs?
Yes, I will wait for Elon to travel on it first though before I go. Talk to you soon!
Yeah and also, many people don't know there's really no correlation between connection quality and service bars either. To answer your question, I'm not sure. What does Minnie Mouse stand for?
That's unusual, I've never thought of heavy metal as literature, but ok. Who's your favorite author?
Really? That is bad. Have you ever scene the scenes without him and the original actor?
WOw I want to try that actually. Unicef donated clean water when you don not use your hpone
they are/ I like grand Torino especially. what is your fave?
yeah, probably a couple. it was 60s TV, a bit campy, but what are you going to do? it was the time of odd soundtracks and weirder clothes.
In Boulder, Colorado you cannot own a pet. You can be their guardian though.
No I didn't but I totally agree with you. I guess Dubai is in a desert region so they need a lot of water to keep the grass green but it still seems wrong just to play golf on it.
That would be cool if you could live in a computer. Sit in the den of the house so all the family members can come ask your advice for the rest of eternity.
I suppose talent could run in the family. I wonder what kind of personality you would need: spending hours inside your head, thinking of the moves and countermoves.
You could hurt yourself! Why would you do that? Does it get you high or something? Crazy.
I did like her in Beauty and the Beast. Its on Netflix if you have access. Brings back memories of childhood
The sax is a great instrument. your son will learn to appreciate music much more. anyway, great chat!
I do know some like he worked at Bubba Gump. Nice chatting with you!
Sounds like a really smart person, what are your thoughts on trans-humanists
yeah, that is pretty cool. What do you think about birds?
I was worried the Sun or smoke had voided the warranty on your computer
