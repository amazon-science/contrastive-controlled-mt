Yeah absolutely, regardless it will be cool to see if Netflix can makea similar show themselves after Game of Thrones ends. Anyways it was nice chatting with you, have a good day!
Yeah when you name kung fu hustle as the supreme acheivement in comedy, I'm going to question your judgement a little bit.
No I didn't but that's neat! I don't think I asked, but what games do you or did you play?
No I didn't but I totally agree with you. I guess Dubai is in a desert region so they need a lot of water to keep the grass green but it still seems wrong just to play golf on it.
On a different note, have you ever heard of K pop?
Yes they can. So you can use amazon to help with your life and then use them for entertainment. After all, they've now got their own film and tv studio.
I did like her in Beauty and the Beast. Its on Netflix if you have access. Brings back memories of childhood
Yeah, that was a good movie. Did you like it?
Very true. Did you now polo shirts were initially invented be a famous tennis player?
That is pretty cool. Do you like to bird watch?
Hi there, do you enjoy watching movies?
I see your point it does look like a silly thing to do, do you like Tim Duncan, he is also another great player.
Yeah, that will do the trick. What about inception, have you seen it?
did you have to drive out of your way for the frozen stuff? like to antarctica?
Nice. I think you should be kinder to yourself if you do ever talk to your dog on the phone. Fastest number to dial on a rotary phone.
