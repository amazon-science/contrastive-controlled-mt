How is the weather in your area ?
Hmm. Do you hunt? Or are the deer protected in your area? There are lots of places that restrict such things.

Hi Turker, are you familiar with Steven Spielberg?
Really? I guess he made a valuable contribution to science and also to medicine, did you hear of that species of flying snakes
Yeah that is crazy. He's actually a good actor in my opinion, have you seen the movie the Revenant? I didn't know that it was a remake of a 1971 movie
WOw I want to try that actually. Unicef donated clean water when you don not use your hpone
I did not. I am glad McDonalds made a drive thru though. Can you imagine going in all the time to place your order?
You do have a point there. I've heard that AT teachers have great reputations so far. So your optimism may be justified haha.
I haven't heard of them until recently. I think it's a funny concept, to poke fun at some of Hollywood's worst productions, but I feel bad for the nominees! Have you seen them?
Yeah, the humble brag, the social comparisons, it is not good for your mind. better to go out and do things that you enjoy.
Hi there. Have you heard of the Razzie Awards? Seems to award the worst movies of the year!
Yes I agree with you! I watch YouTube almost everyday. I can't believe that Google bought YouTube for 1.65 billion dollars back in 2006. That seems like so long ago
That is insane! Oh judge Judy wonder what you do with all your money lol. Anyways, it's been good talking, I hope you have a good night!
I prefer melody and harmony. Who is your favorite artist?
i never realized how good dogs were at knowing what pointing is. but if you point, a dog will follow your finger. its great
Hi friend! What do you enjoy doing with your free time these days?
Yeah can you believe that? Now the franchise of Star Wars is estimated to be worth $65 billion.
I enjoy it. It is such a fun fast paced game to watch. Do you like it?
Hey there how often do you use your telephone?
I do like nintendo games! Do you?
I will have to check that out. Nice chatting with you as well!
I have too, I thought there were plenty of activities and would like to return there, what did you do on your trip?
exactly. pretend you need to ride away from the horror. LOL So, do you like the internet? or is it the bane of your existence?
