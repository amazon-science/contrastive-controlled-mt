he had notoriety to launch a campaign. if you are rich, famous, tall, etc you can run for govt. i figure the future is all about marketing, not content.
No but i get sick of having to check that box or pick cars, trees and storefronts. do you think you would upload your mind to a computer if you could?
Good luck with that elephant! Anyway I enjoyed chatting with you!

I read them sometimes, I mostly rely on Rotten Tomatoes, and you?
I think he is a great actor. Well, nice chatting with you!
Well I guess he's usually considered a producer, but he did a lot of the work on Spartacus. He is a cool guy...you should look up an interview of his.

They also split up simple oil after it became too big of a company. Do you think Trump is doing a good job governing America?

What do you mean, they went to the games until then or they created the schedules?
I suppose creative license to make it sound better to the ear. Do you realize that the velociraptors were only waist high to an adult human?

I honestly like their stand on this. THey have made great careers why would they need a star. Nice chatting with you.
So, Did you even realize that Comedy Central has cancelled over 100 shows since 1989??
I didn't until you just told me! Lego replaced Ferrari as the worlds most powerful brand in 2015.
Yes, if it is your criteria, then video game is a legitimate sport. They have leagues and a lot of betting is done on matches.
I like music and tv. Whats your favorite tv show?
I didn't like the show as well, I loved Seinfeld and Frasier, never really watched Friends until the reruns started playing. My favorite show on tv is Criminal Minds, what is your favorite TV show?

No. I hate snakes. I mean irrational hate! Do you?
That's interesting! Do you like snakes at all? I'm afraid I don't like them. lol
What are your thought on Tina Turner? I think she is really talented
I enjoyed chatting with you as well! And yes I'll go to local pet store and see if they have elephants in stock haha
Have you seen the movie Big Hero 6? It was rendered using a 55,000-core supercomputer. I expect more amazing movies to come out made possible only by computers.
Good morning. Just wondering, would you consider lots of healthy eating as being part of your perfect day?
That sounds pretty cool. I would do it, would you?
I've found it has been so hard to find a movie on Netflix, I have been watching a lot of their original content lately though. Do you watch Netflix?
That's true, too! Well, nice chatting with you, enjoy your day.
I like the Flash and Richie Rich. What is your favorite? I wish I would have thought of the idea for Netflix because they are worth 2 billion today.
I think that in a foxhole,your motivation to succeed would be pretty high. Try that and see what happens. LOL
Hi there. Do you like to play video games?
Good morning! I am good and yourself? Say, do you like dogs by chance?
It is very interesting to know it. I think you read comic books. Who is your superhero ?
Oh lol that's cool. So maybe a hamster is in your future lol I have a dog. The first cloned cat was named copy cat lol
I did not know that, wow! Mind blown! Back to soccer, did you have a favorite team in the world cup?
Oh that is the worse! My goodness watch your children. I have several times had to help a lost child. It is unbelievable! Do you agree that the bathroom is the most annoying feature?
That's unbelievable, upsetting! Yes, I guess you can add that extra butter on your popcorn while watching horror.
I like cast away. I thought his transformation was great. What is your favorite?
You sound like me! I have been to so many concerts and have bought so much music over the years. I have alot to refer back to. Do you have favorite bands?
Do you like Leonardo DiCaprio? He got his start in the 1980's sitcom Growing Pains...
Hi there, have you ever seen Jurassic Park movies?
For sure, a lot of stimulation. I am going to get going though, good talking with you, have a great weekend!
Yes, I did. Do you like Disney?
Have you ever used the Rotten Tomatoes website? I check out all the movies I'm going to watch on there first.
It used to be my nickname! Not because I am as old as Shakespeare... since he was alive during the time of Pocahontas, which is a little older than I. What's your take on SHakespeare?
yeah same. What are some of your favorite disney movies?
lol, I heard you can bring you dog to work while working there, kind of discriminating against cats though!
have you seen guardians of the galaxy?
"it is vague to me but i sort of recall reading it. and of course ""breakfast of champions."" going back to your remark about the fda burning tons of literature, yes it is depressing."
Yes, it is. Who is your favorite team?
I find the universe to be utterly fascinating. How about yourself?
Me too! But, we still can watch it being played. Who's your favorite player?
Yeah I like her. Last season got of the rails a little and I completely understand your dark comment. It can get really dark. I find it entertaining though. What else do you watch?
If you like video games, some of those movies are pretty good, too. I didn't realize Rotten Tomatoes was started by students until recently! Brilliant!,
Read at your your own beat, there is no professor to scold you if you don't finish your book. It takes practice to read fast.
I have no idea they are certainly using it for something. Did you ever play nintendo?
"I guess ya gotta help out your bro. Video games were once called ""cathode ray tube amusement devices"" by the military... Yawn..."
I guess poetry is spoken and written, so it is related to many arts. Do you have a favorite poet?

Speaking of cable tv. What do you think of comedy central?
lol me too. I watch on my game console mostly, but my iphone on the go. I love my iphone, do you like yours
I totally agree with you but on the other hand, it is kind of cool and makes the movies more realistic. Although Mission Impossible-Fallout is pretty far out there as far as realism goes.
Hey how is it going, you ever cook a turkey during Thanksgiving?
If you got it why not? He is worth over 20 billion dollars after all.
You can use your library card to check out books for your kindle or e-reader now. I personally love to do that. Even audiobooks. You can actually get a lot of things from libraries now. Like sewing machines and tools.
That is intriguing. Edgar Allen Poe wrote the oldest known example of a cyborg in fiction. Did you hear that?
thanks! Hopefully you don't grow a white patch on your forehead if you ever get domesticated!
Yes I agree with you! I also like the movie Big Hero 6, have you seen it? Apparently it was rendered using a 55000 core supercomputer
I'm doing well today, how about yourself?
I had no idea! Did you like Beauty and the Beast?
I'm fine. Thanks for asking and you?
I think I would have to say Marvel, I grew up watching shows and reading those comics. How about yourself?
That is an honor. Would Miami be your team being from Florida? They had some glory years not that long ago.
That is interesting I didn't know that. I hope that movie is good. Have you ever seen the sitcom Growing Pains? Apparently Brad Pitt Matthew Perry and also Leonardo DiCaprio were in it at some point
Yes, I heard that too! That's strange to think about. Egosurfing is a term used when looking yourself up on the internet. I would think that would be for those who do it alot! Good chat!
I don't know and I agree with you. He did look thin. I guess maybe Chris Hemsworth, Thor in the movie, was really big in comparison.
Oh I'm Sure. Do you like dogs by the way? We used to have a husky ourselves
I saw it and it was pretty good. Its the fifth installment of the Jurassic Park film series. Have you seen all of them?
Interesting! What kind of dogs do you like?
Not any more but I used to. I do like knowing that in Norway the government will buy copies your book that you publish and put them in libraries. It sounds like they really support their libraries.
I agree, its a good way to fund your company, its amazing how many followers Lord Sandwich has on Instragram 65k!!
Great chatting with you, as well. Enjoy the rest of your afternoon, friend!
Can you imagine looking out your hotel window in Las Vegas and seeing that 50ft robot roaming around!! ha, ha ha!!
Ah cool! You should go more often then lol Did you see the most recent Beauty and the Beast?
I do. Do you like her music?
Minerva. Her name is actually Minerva Mouse. I think Minnie suits her much better don't you?
That guy was everywhere. Did you ever watch wall-e?
I think thats a good idea, afterall you have to listen to your people, you know the like button is actually ilegal in a town of Germany!
I would do exactly the same as you. How could you not pass that up the chance to set yourself up for life? lol
I find it sad that this was not done until 2013. Don't you think it should have been earlier than that?
Cool beans! It's been nice chatting with you this morning. I hope you enjoy the rest of your day.
Yes, I wouldn't be able to function without a car. I don't live close to anything and have to drive everywhere. How about yourself.
"Yeah. Have you ever heard of the Library of Congress' National Book Festival? I guess they celebrate books such as ""The Inner Circle"", ""The Switch"" and even comic books like ""Spinning"" (graphic novel)."
Did you watch the Avengers: Infinity Wars movie ?
Dark Knight also. I think Christian Bale is my favorite Batman. Who's your favorite?
Lol, well it's been nice chatting with you this lovely, fine Florida afternoon. I got to go wash my cat, if you know what I mean, I'll talk to you later, friend.
"It seems that way. I've heard that it's illegal to ""own"" pets in Boulder, Colorado, but you can be their ""guardian."" Does that mean you can claim them on your taxes?"
Yeah I agree that is surprising for sure. Sounds like she had some star studded classmates at the dragon school too! Well it was really nice getting the chance to talk with you!
Ha, maybe you should. Officials in Athens didn't have much faith in elections. They thought it would lead to oligarchy.
True. Then again, if you are recording on a houseboat like Pink Floyd, it doesn't much matter if your ship is going down!
Do you collect anything? I like to collect hats.
Yes, and dogs can donate blood to other dogs. Do your Huskies resemble wolves in any way - to you?
I'll be joining you! Crocodiles are more closely related to birds than they are to snakes and lizards. Odd fact.
Yeah, Hey listen to this it's illegal in south africa to equip a flame-thrower to your car to prevent carjacking.
That is too bad. DO you like Drake?
The Razzie awards are an interesting award show. Have you seen it?
Yeah I love to go dancing. I hope you have a good rest of your day.
Leonard Nimoy played a role in that tv show. Nice chatting with you too!
I do as well! Were you a subscriber even back when their whole business model was about DVD rental by mail and not an online platform?
wow that would be so crazy and intense. I would like to be part of that though some day. I wonder who makes them now. Good chatting with you!
That was good. I heard of him. On another topic, do you use your cell phone a lot?
Yeah you would think drinking salty water through your mouth would taste bad lol
Hahah, actually they look for collar gaps in your clothes
I've heard that too. Hey, what do you think of Morgan Freeman? I never knew until recently that he had been on the electric company back in the 70s!
You too, hope you make it your perfect day.
No I don't know, do you have any idea, if yes how much was the first purchase?
wow but you know that the most important things about clothing is that it protects your body from weather conditions
That's a nice sentiment on his part. There are wizard of oz inspired shoes that actually guide you home when you click your heels together using a gps system. That's pretty amazing and fun.
Wow! That is like a premonition. I guess I will make a joke about winning Power Ball. I guess you know that the raptors are not computer generated, but are people in dinosaur suits?
Yes it is. Mostly by oceans but also lakes, rivers, and other sources! Well it was lovely getting to talk with you!
And would you consider it as a promotion ? It does not look good in a résumé, unless your are a comedian.
No I do think that's true on another movies note, why did you think of Jurassic world Fallen Kingdom? I thought it was horrible
I will have to check that out lol! It was so nice chatting with you, enjoy your weekend!
Yeah I have watched both seasons, its very much styled like old shows from the 80s, and I love it. I can't wait for season 3. What is your favorite Netflix show?
Oh really? I didn't know that, that must be a great investment! Lots of fans have superstitions surrounding games, do you have any?
Well, the thing is, if something happens to your body, then your athletic career is gone, but education can never go away. So, I guess it depends what you prioritize.
I wonder what that entails. Speaking of aggressive, you can legally equip your car with flamethrowers in South Africa to prevent carjacking. Crazy!
Leonard Nimoy played a role in that tv show. Nice chatting with you too!
Life is short. I think you should pursue your dream, if you can. I like Ryan Stiles.
you have a nice weekend as well.
I did and loved it so much, and you?
It's like the new standard bearer for PSVR. Basically, it is a game that unfolds within the pages of an illustrated book. Speaking of books, what's your opinion on libraries?
"I hear you. Do you do something different for your front yard versus back yard? We have a decent front yard, but a rocky back yard. ""curb appeal"""
Yes. Did you see him in the shawshank redemption? That movie was very moving.
Thats nice, so im guessing your more of a dog person that a cat person?
Oh wow, definitely not! Anyways, I am going to get going, great chatting with you, take care and have a great night!
Would you want to upload your mind to a memory stick?
I do love Netflix. What is your favorite show on there?
You would still have rights in Germany though, no matter what holdovers from your ancestors. Under the 1912 Scottish Protection of Animals Act, the Loch Ness monster is a protected species.
So what would be your team, which jersey would you want for a tweet?
I guess poetry is spoken and written, so it is related to many arts. Do you have a favorite poet?
oh wow I didn't know that, they are definitely very successful, they even released a handheld specifically for a pokemon game if that tells you anything
Intriguing. Did you hear about the judge in Michigan who delivered a ruling againt him? She delivered it by rapping when she ruled.
I wonder how that banning action would fare in today's world and society, you think it would receive negative press?
Also amazing, i love those shows about ocean life, theres a whole way of life down there, do you ever watch Blue Planet? Whats your favorite water animal? I love Orcas and Octopus
Lets talk about Children's Literature next. The government in Norway will buy 1000 copies of your book that you publish in Norway to distribute to libraries, 1500 if its a children's book.
Sounds like a really busy guy, anyways its time for lunch, its been great chatting with you but Im taking a break, thanks a lot
I can just about see that, funny the things that can change your life, I wonder what he was doing before that.
lol weird. Been great chatting with you!
Yah, it's quite a bit larger than a baseball for sure, I've never seen a softball video game though, have you?
Yeah, I found that out a few years ago, there is so much ocean that hasn't been explored. Can you imagine what is in there?
I love the original 3 like you. But the new ones are bad, I agree.
Yeah same here, I like to be able to at least play every sport just a bit once. Do you follow tennis at all?
That's really cool that you seem to be in good spirits about it, much like the little boy. I guess an event like that can really change your overall perspective.
I agree. Do you do any online shopping on Amazon.com? Amazon sells almost everything from A to Z.
That is a lucky cat! They're lucky that it didn't have rabies to LOL, how often do you use your telephone by the way? I use my cell phone almost everyday.
ya I do think they have a lot of power at present, I don't know that I want them expanding out much further, they control a lot of information, do you do any reading in your spare time?
That is interesting I didn't know that. I hope that movie is good. Have you ever seen the sitcom Growing Pains? Apparently Brad Pitt Matthew Perry and also Leonardo DiCaprio were in it at some point
No, I had no clue. Well I have to go, nice chatting with you
Would you steal a garden gnome to take on your road trip and then return the gnome with photos?
Haha that is super creative. Do you ever read movie reviews?
I am into nonfiction and history. What is your favorite book?
I do not think $7500 is a lot of money to provide Darth Vader's voice because the movie was very successful. What do you think?
Yeah crazy. do you remember beauty and the beasts?
That's insane. I just learned they have Wizard of Oz inspired shoes that can guide you home when you click you heels
Very interesting. Was this President an independence in your opinion?
Well, you can search up yourself and you can probably find your Facebook account or something.
I love it. Have you read the poem Chaos?
Thank goodness, indeed. I agree with you, though, there is still progress to be made, and I think reading diverse fiction and poetry can help people see things from other perspectives.
Yeah, just saw him the latest Disney rendition of The Nutcracker. Did you see that?
Do you watch the show Fixer Upper?
I did play with Legos, my favorite, what about you?
it's a funny thing. i used to read a lot but these days i spend more time listening to music but i have been thinking about getting back into the reading. who are some of your fav authors?

Calling you to confirm your booking details and other dates with you. Is that okay?
I don't know if your phone backs up automatically or if (you've lost) if you don't have enough memory, but that seems like that would be really important.

your cell signal gets rerouted to a different place.

Your family don't even gotta be your reckless family members. They could be people just add on to your family and stuff like that.
So you (install) in your family hassle hard cause that the type of family you came from like of survivors. Like y'all came
Now they are your family members I don't know what word to use here.
Not like you're trying to make it a bigger deal. but that might be when you're trying to do things with ease, that might be how it works out.
So your values and principles can be aligned but you might think about how to get there in a different way?
That sounds like that makes a lot of sense, your next step.
live in a million multimillion-dollar house, drive nice cars, take your kids to college, like you don't have to make a hundred million a year to live comfortably

Other grandparents, even though I don't get along with my wife's parents, I have them around just so they can learn something from the older generation, to pass on and spread you know?
you know, boys are favourite, boys are just like me.

So what would be like of your process, specifically with the Flair since you, unlike traditional expresso, you have this limitation built in what will be your approach. Let's say you got a new coffee
it does not translate to the Flair. A general good place to start is on your basket what the recommended dose is and to start with what they say
I would certainly never buy it for myself. I like some of the doughnuts that we had that are like dough. What's that place that we used to go on your way to work?
there are actually so many (mister) you can make there to inference your copyright you didn't make any of them.
I go pick up the buttered noodles and bring them over and then say here is your food that tastes like nothing so you can eat it and go to sleep and then eat it tomorrow

That's so funny. Well, are you the kind of person that likes to have a lot of attention frequently during the day or that coming, you know, kind of bother your or because it it's personal time.
Girls were beautiful and they were like when I first a girl comes to me, she is like hey, I know who you are from your picture on Facebook and I am like, okay, like I didn't really know
So I don't know what she's going to do next. Well, how old is your grandbaby?
Oh yeah, I do and I think and my husband does too. Have you ever seen a shrimp that's the size of your palm? There are some really big shrimp here in Florida
Got it. Any of your family members ever done something to put like you're on the famous.
Just thought he would be born with like just your family.
Also your financial so it's everything you have to take into consideration. But I can't believe that if it costs that much to eat in the future.
And even college for your children, what you should not do a lot of great it's a very quick read book and easy to follow even from for a young person, so
I'm pretty good, I had a very interesting morning. I'll tell you about it while you handle your texts and stuff.
Are you saying that I don't have your best interest at heart
Your college essays must have been incredible. It must've been absolutely impeccable.
that's the closest. I mean what about yourself.
Like in your house like growing up?
you know, wherever they were just like watching the polls come in or whatever but you were in your dorm?
It's okay I mean, he said he's going to pay via PayPal and can you just text me your PayPal?
do your own thing, which was awesome and it was a great place to be. I don't know if you have any location that struck? You guys are international travel.
where it's sort of like on Qatar airways or Etihad, just the service services a masculine, you know, you get, if you're flying first class, you get your own
And with little mashed potatoes and some broccoli can't really go wrong. what, what's your go-to?
was your sister throwing up at this point?
also your proximity to (LA), if you need to be there for the big reunion, shows or like whatever it is, or if you're new to a recording session in LA you can get there. feasibly, you know
I mean it's a little weird, you are working on the weekend, so it's like you know
what do I like about my work? what you like about your makeup and about doing makeup?
If you can just get yourself incarcerated maybe everything would work out.
your car now I know it sounds callous but as I said sometimes I think that is a more favourable option anyway.
I just see how I can be without a degree. there are so many jobs you can't enable yourself into new jobs anymore.
So what is your secret, your favourite secret show, like a show that you love that you wouldn't, that people wouldn't think that you like?
so many roaches, I don't even know, pick your worst project. Ten times how many roaches are in there, and they just be killed, just be in the eating, cooking, is gross.
So, okay, lemme see, lemme test your age and see if I can guess. I think you're about my age. How was the, how do you, what's the oldest way you remember to get the prizes?
close by who is diverting your attention.
what's your favourite TV show at the moment.
Don't put that in your mouth, put those in your mouth, don't put that in your mouth. Goodbye sorry, let's hold on.
the thing was I was like what career, your songs are all bad.
do your parents use a DVD player?
I don't know. What are yours?
and also just in your life. What are your favorite movies?
It starts with them getting the order. Like your brother's leading into a trap and it basically just follows them like going
Excuse me. Does your job require a uniform?
Now you, where do you work currently? A pizzeria. Is this what you, this isn't your career though?
I might sound strange, but I feel like people buy less electronics these days because everything has been condensed. Like, my phone, your cellphone, is like ten things
So what's your friend, sorry for asking, what does she do?
which governs best governs least, I think that was must have been predicated on the notion that you're saying that from a place of being informed yourself
I think it's not just for an interview. There's a lot of people that say, just do it every morning and yet it changes your day.
it's just we're more expensive, higher quality, but not really, it's just here you can get a baggete
you know, very smart move but, it's just expensive, you know what I mean it's like you really want to buy that
because we knew that they weren't gonna continue to buy if they are going to but it seems that the Amazon made it possible like they can give you just like print out the label
They are trying to refund your money back into an Amazon credit so why they don't return to your credit card.
Yeah, that's Walmart that's way better, you can get all of these things in Walmart
you have to order all bunch of stuff, but you know, they're not making money on that either but suck it,
and I think also that if we are going to say true to you know trying to fix the planet,
the same as recycling styrofoam,it's like you have to put them into landfill and it stays there forever, and unwanted clothing now is like all-time high
and as long as we can just keep on buying it and profiting it, it's just gonna be there and that's you know
you close the account and you can do that online, you can give the cause and then closing my account tomorrow and my my sister's
No. Well, I don't know if no, you know, you put your account. I mean it gets harder, but there is not a lot to cancel your number.
you could get GoogleTV which I have now, it's like fifty dollars a month and you can get channels, so you get everything to get the history channel, but you get
Yeah, like even HBO you can get through crime.
Yeah, something like that. What do you shop anyone like shop.
you know fancy boots like whatever store Whitemen sample sale they can go on eBay and sell them to someone in the middle of the country who doesn't have
they quote-unquote blast the number and it was like there is big oh, now you can have it like, that's my number, I want that.
I mean that's definitely something that I mean retail (modern) you need to tell you that.
what do you mean put it in .
You don't really know exactly where it's coming from and so it's tough to put all your faith in that.
there's no magic science, I choose this store because of that, what are your needs? Okay.
No, I mean, and there are definitely steps to cooking it, like what your mom did, the rice and then add the milk and all.
What did your friend think about all this? Are you an adventurous spirit? He just goes along and seemed to enjoy it or what?
you never know what you could take from another culture and incorporate into your own and make it better.
I don't need your advice, I just need your cash.
I actually read a book or, imagine, I read a book on your love language and learning it, your attachment styles and stuff with your partner
I can accommodate your agenda, but it's always just like a problem like for example when I first met Joseph
it could be like a belt-like, you can latch it on to yourself like even. It's just the possibility like this is more functional than a pop socket
And in your city of kids that are looking ,
Okay. The first topic is my favorite movie. What's your favorite movie?
a stranger off the street like your average Joe, you know, like they could be, it's too different. I mean people will throw people off.
That's true. but yeah, that's another thing when friends don't budget correctly and then they're out there and your like I'm not giving you money.
So, I'm gonna back to the email on January second. well, that stuff gonna hit your credit card now. I hope so.
How does he respond? He'll answer your question by reciting a line from his favourite book.
So, they're not all, so, what I meant by on the same level or on a different level is not necessarily how yours was done up. I know your company divides the students into levels.
So what is your profession? How would you describe that?
Yes, then no, but your salary is pennies. Like living with an American, like a half American salary, or even, really half an American salary in South-East Asia you live like a king.
Yeah. What about yourself? What do you do?
think of your iPhone, if you could just fold your iPhone in half.
Then you can put in your pocket and use when you want to flip it out, it's a full screen.
The phone, I think, things that are going to be able to do things. You know, like, let's use your eyes to, like, have the page go down and stuff like that.
Sometimes you can work at your total hours too, which is another, kind of great thing
Now you, where do you work currently? A pizzeria. Is this what you, this isn't your career though?
Yeah, it's your body, regulating what's happening, science
That's so funny. Well, are you the kind of person that likes to have a lot of attention frequently during the day or that coming, you know, kind of bother your or because it it's personal time.
If you can just get yourself incarcerated maybe everything would work out.
I don't need your advice, I just need your cash.

You know they start off young. They start off when you young, you know what I mean. Take you to the basketball. Go play basketball, football
it up and try to refund yours, but I cannot guarantee this.
Not like you're trying to make it a bigger deal. but that might be when you're trying to do things with ease, that might be how it works out.
No. Well, I don't know if no, you know, you put your account. I mean it gets harder, but there is not a lot to cancel your number.

your trainer at the gym, that's your family too because he is helping you get fit, you know what I am saying
So, I'm gonna back to the email on January second. well, that stuff gonna hit your credit card now. I hope so.

May I get your email ID, please?
they quote-unquote blast the number and it was like there is big oh, now you can have it like, that's my number, I want that.
