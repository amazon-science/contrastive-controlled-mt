Back in New York, I am the head of development for a non-profit called Robin Hood.
When I'm not fighting poverty, I'm fighting fires as the assistant captain of a volunteer fire company.
Now in our town, where the volunteers supplement a highly skilled career staff, you have to get to the fire scene pretty early to get in on any action.
I remember my first fire.
I was the second volunteer on the scene, so there was a pretty good chance I was going to get in.
But still it was a real footrace against the other volunteers to get to the captain in charge to find out what our assignments would be.
When I found the captain, he was having a very engaging conversation with the homeowner, who was surely having one of the worst days of her life.
Here it was, the middle of the night, she was standing outside in the pouring rain, under an umbrella, in her pajamas, barefoot, while her house was in flames.
The other volunteer who had arrived just before me — let's call him Lex Luther — (Laughter) got to the captain first and was asked to go inside and save the homeowner's dog. The dog! I was stunned with jealousy.
Here was some lawyer or money manager who, for the rest of his life, gets to tell people that he went into a burning building to save a living creature, just because he beat me by five seconds.
Well, I was next.
The captain waved me over.
He said, "Bezos, I need you to go into the house.
I need you to go upstairs, past the fire, and I need you to get this woman a pair of shoes. "(Laughter) I swear.
So, not exactly what I was hoping for, but off I went — up the stairs, down the hall, past the 'real' firefighters, who were pretty much done putting out the fire at this point, into the master bedroom to get a pair of shoes.
Now I know what you're thinking, but I'm no hero. (Laughter) I carried my payload back downstairs where I met my nemesis and the precious dog by the front door.
We took our treasures outside to the homeowner, where, not surprisingly, his received much more attention than did mine.
A few weeks later, the department received a letter from the homeowner thanking us for the valiant effort displayed in saving her home.
The act of kindness she noted above all others: someone had even gotten her a pair of shoes.
(Laughter)
In both my vocation at Robin Hood and my avocation as a volunteer firefighter, I am witness to acts of generosity and kindness on a monumental scale, but I'm also witness to acts of grace and courage on an individual basis.
And you know what I've learned? They all matter. So as I look around this room at people who either have achieved, or are on their way to achieving, remarkable levels of success, I would offer this reminder: don't wait.
Don't wait until you make your first million to make a difference in somebody's life.
If you have something to give, give it now.
Serve food at a soup kitchen. Clean up a neighborhood park. Be a mentor.
Not every day is going to offer us a chance to save somebody's life, but every day offers us an opportunity to affect one.
So get in the game. Save the shoes.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Bruno Giussani: Mark, Mark, come back.
Mark Bezos: Thank you.
I just came back from a community that holds the secret to human survival.
It's a place where women run the show, have sex to say hello, and play rules the day — where fun is serious business.
And no, this isn't Burning Man or San Francisco. (Laughter) Ladies and gentlemen, meet your cousins.
This is the world of wild bonobos in the jungles of Congo.
Bonobos are, together with chimpanzees, your living closest relative.
That means we all share a common ancestor, an evolutionary grandmother, who lived around six million years ago.
Now, chimpanzees are well-known for their aggression.
(Laughter)
But unfortunately, we have made too much of an emphasis of this aspect in our narratives of human evolution.
But bonobos show us the other side of the coin. While chimpanzees are dominated by big, scary guys, bonobo society is run by empowered females.
These guys have really worked something out, since this leads to a highly tolerant society where fatal violence has not been observed yet.
But unfortunately, bonobos are the least understood of the great apes.
They live in the depths of the Congolese jungle, and it has been very difficult to study them.
The Congo is a paradox — a land of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty, but also the heart of darkness itself — the scene of a violent conflict that has raged for decades and claimed nearly as many lives as the First World War.
Not surprisingly, this destruction also endangers bonobo survival.
Bushmeat trades and forest loss means we couldn't fill a small stadium with all the bonobos that are left in the world — and we're not even sure of that to be honest.
Yet, in this land of violence and chaos, you can hear hidden laughter swaying the trees.
Who are these cousins? We know them as the "make love, not war" apes since they have frequent, promiscuous and bisexual sex to manage conflict and solve social issues.
Now, I'm not saying this is the solution to all of humanity's problems — since there's more to bonobo life than the Kama Sutra.
Bonobos, like humans, love to play throughout their entire lives.
Play is not just child's games.
For us and them, play is foundational for bonding relationships and fostering tolerance.
It's where we learn to trust and where we learn about the rules of the game.
Play increases creativity and resilience, and it's all about the generation of diversity — diversity of interactions, diversity of behaviors, diversity of connections.
And when you watch bonobo play, you're seeing the very evolutionary roots of human laughter, dance and ritual.
Play is the glue that binds us together.
Now, I don't know how you play, but I want to show you a couple of unique clips fresh from the wild.
First, it's a ball game bonobo-style — and I do not mean football.
So here, we have a young female and a male engaged in a chase game.
Have a look what she's doing.
It might be the evolutionary origin of the phrase, "she's got him by the balls." (Laughter) Only I think that he's rather loving it here, right?
Yeah. (Laughter) So sex play is common in both bonobos and humans.
And this video is really interesting because it shows — this video's really interesting because it shows the inventiveness of bringing unusual elements into play — such as testicles — and also how play both requires trust and fosters trust — while at the same time being tremendous fun.
But play's a shapeshifter. (Laughter) Play's a shapeshifter, and it can take many forms, some of which are more quiet, imaginative, curious — maybe where wonder is discovered anew.
And I want you to see, this is Fuku, a young female, and she is quietly playing with water.
I think, like her, we sometimes play alone, and we explore the boundaries of our inner and our outer worlds.
And it's that playful curiosity that drives us to explore, drives us to interact, and then the unexpected connections we form are the real hotbed for creativity.
So these are just small tasters into the insights that bonobo give us to our past and present.
But they also hold a secret for our future, a future where we need to adapt to an increasingly challenging world through greater creativity and greater cooperation.
The secret is that play is the key to these capacities.
In other words, play is our adaptive wildcard.
In order to adapt successfully to a changing world, we need to play.
But will we make the most of our playfulness?
Play is not frivolous. Play's essential. For bonobos and humans alike, life is not just red in tooth and claw.
In times when it seems least appropriate to play, it might be the times when it is most urgent.
And so, my fellow primates, let us embrace this gift from evolution and play together, as we rediscover creativity, fellowship and wonder.
Thank you.
(Applause)
I want you now to imagine a wearable robot that gives you superhuman abilities, or another one that takes wheelchair users up standing and walking again.
We at Berkeley Bionics call these robots exoskeletons.
These are nothing else than something that you put on in the morning, and it will give you extra strength, and it will further enhance your speed, and it will help you, for instance, to manage your balance.
It is actually the true integration of the man and the machine.
But not only that — it will integrate and network you to the universe and other devices out there.
This is just not some blue sky thinking.
To show you now what we are working on by starting out talking about the American soldier, that on average does carry about 100 lbs. on their backs, and they are being asked to carry more equipment.
Obviously, this is resulting in some major complications — back injuries, 30 percent of them — chronic back injuries.
So we thought we would look at this challenge and create an exoskeleton that would help deal with this issue.
So let me now introduce to you HULC — or the Human Universal Load Carrier.
Soldier: With the HULC exoskeleton, I can carry 200 lbs. over varied terrain for many hours.
Its flexible design allows for deep squats, crawls and high-agility movements.
It senses what I want to do, where I want to go, and then augments my strength and endurance.
Eythor Bender: We are ready with our industry partner to introduce this device, this new exoskeleton this year.
So this is for real.
Now let's turn our heads towards the wheelchair users, something that I'm particularly passionate about.
There are 68 million people estimated to be in wheelchairs worldwide.
This is about one percent of the total population.
And that's actually a conservative estimate.
We are talking here about, oftentimes, very young individuals with spinal cord injuries, that in the prime of their life — 20s, 30s, 40s — hit a wall and the wheelchair's the only option.
But it is also the aging population that is multiplying in numbers.
And the only option, pretty much — when it's stroke or other complications — is the wheelchair.
And that is actually for the last 500 years, since its very successful introduction, I must say.
So we thought we would start writing a brand new chapter of mobility.
Let me now introduce you to eLEGS that is worn by Amanda Boxtel that 19 years ago was spinal cord injured, and as a result of that she has not been able to walk for 19 years until now.
(Applause)
Amanda Boxtel: Thank you.
EB: Amanda is wearing our eLEGS set. It has sensors. It's completely non-invasive, sensors in the crutches that send signals back to our onboard computer that is sitting here at her back.
There are battery packs here as well that power motors that are sitting at her hips, as well as her knee joints, that move her forward in this kind of smooth and very natural gait.
AB: I was 24 years old and at the top of my game when a freak summersault while downhill skiing paralyzed me.
In a split second, I lost all sensation and movement below my pelvis.
Not long afterwards, a doctor strode into my hospital room, and he said, "Amanda, you'll never walk again." And that was 19 yeas ago.
He robbed every ounce of hope from my being.
Adaptive technology has since enabled me to learn how to downhill ski again, to rock climb and even handcycle.
But nothing has been invented that enables me to walk, until now.
(Applause)
Thank you.
EB: As you can see, we have the technology, we have the platforms to sit down and have discussions with you.
It's in our hands, and we have all the potential here to change the lives of future generations — not only for the soldiers, or for Amanda here and all the wheelchair users, but for everyone.
AB: Thanks.
(Applause)
I have spent the past few years putting myself into situations that are usually very difficult and at the same time somewhat dangerous.
I went to prison — difficult.
I worked in a coal mine — dangerous.
I filmed in war zones — difficult and dangerous.
And I spent 30 days eating nothing but this — fun in the beginning, little difficult in the middle, very dangerous in the end.
In fact, most of my career, I've been immersing myself into seemingly horrible situations for the whole goal of trying to examine societal issues in a way that make them engaging, that make them interesting, that hopefully break them down in a way that make them entertaining and accessible to an audience.
So when I knew I was coming here to do a TED Talk that was going to look at the world of branding and sponsorship, I knew I would want to do something a little different.
So as some of you may or may not have heard, a couple weeks ago, I took out an ad on eBay.
I sent out some Facebook messages, some Twitter messages, and I gave people the opportunity to buy the naming rights to my 2011 TED Talk. (Laughter) That's right, some lucky individual, corporation, for-profit or non-profit, was going to get the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity — because I'm sure Chris Anderson will never let it happen again — (Laughter) to buy the naming rights to the talk you're watching right now, that at the time didn't have a title, didn't really have a lot of content and didn't really give much hint as to what the subject matter would actually be.
So what you were getting was this: Your name here presents: My TED Talk that you have no idea what the subject is and, depending on the content, could ultimately blow up in your face, especially if I make you or your company look stupid for doing it.
But that being said, it's a very good media opportunity. (Laughter) You know how many people watch these TED Talks? It's a lot. That's just a working title, by the way. (Laughter) So even with that caveat, I knew that someone would buy the naming rights.
Now if you'd have asked me that a year ago, I wouldn't have been able to tell you that with any certainty.
But in the new project that I'm working on, my new film, we examine the world of marketing, advertising.
And as I said earlier, I put myself in some pretty horrible situations over the years, but nothing could prepare me, nothing could ready me, for anything as difficult or as dangerous as going into the rooms with these guys. (Laughter) You see, I had this idea for a movie.
(Video) Morgan Spurlock: What I want to do is make a film all about product placement, marketing and advertising, where the entire film is funded by product placement, marketing and advertising.
So the movie will be called "The Greatest Movie Ever Sold." So what happens in "The Greatest Movie Ever Sold," is that everything from top to bottom, from start to finish, is branded from beginning to end — from the above-the-title sponsor that you'll see in the movie, which is brand X. Now this brand, the Qualcomm Stadium, the Staples Center... these people will be married to the film in perpetuity — forever.
And so the film explores this whole idea — (Michael Kassan: It's redundant.) It's what? (MK: It's redundant.) In perpetuity, forever?
I'm a redundant person. (MK: I'm just saying.) That was more for emphasis.
It was, "In perpetuity. Forever." But not only are we going to have the brand X title sponsor, but we're going to make sure we sell out every category we can in the film.
So maybe we sell a shoe and it becomes the greatest shoe you ever wore... the greatest car you ever drove from "The Greatest Movie Ever Sold," the greatest drink you've ever had, courtesy of "The Greatest Movie Ever Sold."
Xavier Kochhar: So the idea is, beyond just showing that brands are a part of your life, but actually get them to finance the film? (MS: Get them to finance the film.)
MS: And actually we show the whole process of how does it work.
The goal of this whole film is transparency.
You're going to see the whole thing take place in this movie.
So that's the whole concept, the whole film, start to finish.
And I would love for CEG to help make it happen.
Robert Friedman: You know it's funny, because when I first hear it, it is the ultimate respect for an audience.
Guy: I don't know how receptive people are going to be to it, though.
XK: Do you have a perspective — I don't want to use "angle" because that has a negative connotation — but do you know how this is going to play out? (MS: No idea.)
David Cohn: How much money does it take to do this?
MS: 1.5 million. (DC: Okay.)
John Kamen: I think that you're going to have a hard time meeting with them, but I think it's certainly worth pursuing a couple big, really obvious brands.
XK: Who knows, maybe by the time your film comes out, we look like a bunch of blithering idiots.
MS: What do you think the response is going to be?
Stuart Ruderfer: The responses mostly will be "no."
MS: But is it a tough sell because of the film or a tough sell because of me?
JK: Both.
MS:... Meaning not so optimistic.
So, sir, can you help me? I need help.
MK: I can help you.
MS: Okay. (MK: Good.) Awesome.
MK: We've gotta figure out which brands.
MS: Yeah. (MK: That's the challenge.) When you look at the people you deal with..
MK: We've got some places we can go. (MS: Okay.) Turn the camera off.
MS: I thought "Turn the camera off" meant, "Let's have an off-the-record conversation." Turns out it really means, "We want nothing to do with your movie."
MS: And just like that, one by one, all of these companies suddenly disappeared.
None of them wanted anything to do with this movie. I was amazed. They wanted absolutely nothing to do with this project.
And I was blown away, because I thought the whole concept, the idea of advertising, was to get your product out in front of as many people as possible, to get as many people to see it as possible.
Especially in today's world, this intersection of new media and old media and the fractured media landscape, isn't the idea to get that new buzz-worthy delivery vehicle that's going to get that message to the masses?
No, that's what I thought.
But the problem was, you see, my idea had one fatal flaw, and that flaw was this.
Actually no, that was not the flaw whatsoever.
That wouldn't have been a problem at all.
This would have been fine.
But what this image represents was the problem.
See, when you do a Google image search for transparency, this is — - (Laughter) (Applause) This is one of the first images that comes up.
So I like the way you roll, Sergey Brin.
No. (Laughter) This is was the problem: transparency — free from pretense or deceit; easily detected or seen through; readily understood; characterized by visibility or accessibility of information, especially concerning business practices — that last line being probably the biggest problem.
You see, we hear a lot about transparency these days.
Our politicians say it, our president says it, even our CEO's say it.
But suddenly when it comes down to becoming a reality, something suddenly changes. But why? Well, transparency is scary — (Roar) like that odd, still-screaming bear. (Laughter) It's unpredictable — (Music) (Laughter) like this odd country road.
And it's also very risky. (Laughter) What else is risky?
Eating an entire bowl of Cool Whip. (Laughter) That's very risky.
Now when I started talking to companies and telling them that we wanted to tell this story, and they said, "No, we want you to tell a story.
We want you to tell a story, but we just want to tell our story. "See, when I was a kid and my father would catch me in some sort of a lie — and there he is giving me the look he often gave me — he would say," Son, there's three sides to every story.
There's your story, there's my story and there's the real story. "Now you see, with this film, we wanted to tell the real story.
But with only one company, one agency willing to help me — and that's only because I knew John Bond and Richard Kirshenbaum for years — I realized that I would have to go on my own, I'd have to cut out the middleman and go to the companies myself with all of my team.
So what you suddenly started to realize — or what I started to realize — is that when you started having conversations with these companies, the idea of understanding your brand is a universal problem.
(Video) MS: I have friends who make great big, giant Hollywood films, and I have friends who make little independent films like I make.
And the friends of mine who make big, giant Hollywood movies say the reason their films are so successful is because of the brand partners that they have.
And then my friends who make small independent films say, "Well, how are we supposed to compete with these big, giant Hollywood movies?" And the movie is called "The Greatest Movie Ever Sold." So how specifically will we see Ban in the film?
Any time I'm ready to go, any time I open up my medicine cabinet, you will see Ban deodorant.
While anytime I do an interview with someone, I can say, "Are you fresh enough for this interview? Are you ready? You look a little nervous.
I want to help you calm down.
So maybe you should put some one before the interview. "So we'll offer one of these fabulous scents.
Whether it's a "Floral Fusion" or a "Paradise Winds," they'll have their chance.
We will have them geared for both male or female — solid, roll-on or stick, whatever it may be.
That's the two-cent tour.
So now I can answer any of your questions and give you the five-cent tour.
Karen Frank: We are a smaller brand.
Much like you talked about being a smaller movie, we're very much a challenger brand.
So we don't have the budgets that other brands have.
So doing things like this — you know, remind people about Ban — is kind of why were interested in it.
MS: What are the words that you would use to describe Ban? Ban is blank.
KF: That's a great question.
MS: Technology's not the way you want to describe something somebody's putting in their armpit.
Man: We talk about bold, fresh.
I think "fresh" is a great word that really spins this category into the positive, versus "fights odor and wetness." It keeps you fresh.
How do we keep you fresher longer — better freshness, more freshness, three times fresher.
Things like that that are more of that positive benefit.
MS: And that's a multi-million dollar corporation. What about me? What about a regular guy?
I need to go talk to the man on the street, the people who are like me, the regular Joes.
They need to tell me about my brand.
(Video) MS: How would you guys describe your brand?
Man: Um, my brand? I don't know. I like really nice clothes.
Woman: 80's revival meets skater-punk, unless it's laundry day.
MS: All right, what is brand Gerry?
Gerry: Unique. (MS: Unique.)
Man: I guess what kind of genre, style I am would be like dark glamor.
I like a lot of black colors, a lot of grays and stuff like that.
But usually I have an accessory, like sunglasses, or I like crystal and things like that too.
Woman: If Dan were a brand, he might be a classic convertible Mercedes Benz.
Man 2: The brand that I am is, I would call it casual fly.
Woman 2: Part hippie, part yogi, part Brooklyn girl — I don't know.
Man 3: I'm the pet guy.
I sell pet toys all over the country, all over the world.
So I guess that's my brand.
In my warped little industry, that's my brand.
Man 4: My brand is FedEx because I deliver the goods.
Man 5: Failed writer-alcoholic brand. Is that something?
Lawyer: I'm a lawyer brand.
Tom: I'm Tom.
MS: Well we can't all be brand Tom, but I do often find myself at the intersection of dark glamor and casual fly.
(Laughter)
And what I realized is I needed an expert.
I needed somebody who could get inside my head, somebody who could really help me understand what they call your "brand personality." And so I found a company called Olson Zaltman in Pittsburg.
They've helped companies like Nestle, Febreze, Hallmark discover that brand personality.
If they could do it for them, surely they could do it for me.
(Video) Abigail: You brought your pictures, right?
MS: I did. The very first picture is a picture of my family.
A: So tell me a little bit how it relates to your thoughts and feelings about who you are.
MS: These are the people who shape the way I look at the world.
A: Tell me about this world.
MS: This world? I think your world is the world that you live in — like people who are around you, your friends, your family, the way you live your life, the job you do.
All those things stemmed and started from one place, and for me they stemmed and started with my family in West Virginia.
A: What's the next one you want to talk about?
MS: The next one: This was the best day ever.
A: How does this relate to your thoughts and feelings about who you are?
A: Tell me about the "why" phase — what does that do for us?
What is the machete?
What pupa stage are you in now?
Why is it important to reboot?
What does the red represent?
Tell me a little bit about that part.
... A little more about you that is not who you are.
What are some other metamorphoses that you've had?
... Doesn't have to be fear.
What kind of roller coaster are you on?
MS: EEEEEE! (A: Thank you.) No, thank you.
A: Thanks for you patience. (MS: Great job.)
A: Yeah. (MS: Thanks a lot.) All right.
MS: Yeah, I don't know what's going to come of this.
There was a whole lot of crazy going on in there.
Lindsay Zaltman: The first thing we saw was this idea that you had two distinct, but complementary sides to your brand personality — the Morgan Spurlock brand is a mindful / play brand.
Those are juxtaposed very nicely together.
And I think there's almost a paradox with those.
And I think some companies will just focus on one of their strengths or the other instead of focusing on both.
Most companies tend to — and it's human nature — to avoid things that they're not sure of, avoid fear, those elements, and you really embrace those, and you actually turn them into positives for you, and it's a neat thing to see.
What other brands are like that?
The first on here is the classic, Apple.
And you can see here too, Target, Wii, Mini from the Mini Coopers, and JetBlue.
Now there's playful brands and mindful brands, those things that have come and gone, but a playful, mindful brand is a pretty powerful thing.
MS: A playful, mindful brand.
What is your brand?
If somebody asked you to describe your brand identity, your brand personality, what would you be?
Are you an up attribute?
Are you something that gets the blood flowing?
Or are you more of a down attribute?
Are you something that's a little more calm, reserved, conservative?
Up attributes are things like being playful, being fresh like the Fresh Prince, contemporary, adventurous, edgy or daring like Errol Flynn, nimble or agile, profane, domineering, magical or mystical like Gandalf.
Or are you more of a down attribute?
Are you mindful, sophisticated like 007?
Are you established, traditional, nurturing, protective, empathetic like the Oprah?
Are you reliable, stable, familiar, safe, secure, sacred, contemplative or wise like the Dalai Lama or Yoda?
Over the course of this film, we had 500-plus companies who were up and down companies saying, "no," they didn't want any part of this project.
They wanted nothing to do with this film, mainly because they would have no control, they would have no control over the final product.
But we did get 17 brand partners who were willing to relinquish that control, who wanted to be in business with someone as mindful and as playful as myself and who ultimately empowered us to tell stories that normally we wouldn't be able to tell — stories that an advertiser would normally never get behind.
They enabled us to tell the story about neuromarketing, as we got into telling the story in this film about how now they're using MRI's to target the desire centers of your brain for both commercials as well as movie marketing.
We went to San Paulo where they have banned outdoor advertising.
In the entire city for the past five years, there's no billboards, there's no posters, there's no flyers, nothing. (Applause) And we went to school districts where now companies are making their way into cash-strapped schools all across America.
What's incredible for me is the projects that I've gotten the most feedback out of, or I've had the most success in, are ones where I've interacted with things directly.
And that's what these brands did. They cut out the middleman, they cut out their agencies and said, "Maybe these agencies don't have my best interest in mind.
I'm going to deal directly with the artist.
I'm going to work with him to create something different, something that's going to get people thinking, that's going to challenge the way we look at the world. "
And how has that been for them? Has it been successful? Well, since the film premiered at the Sundance Film Festival, let's take a look.
According to Burrelles, the movie premiered in January, and since then — and this isn't even the whole thing — we've had 900 million media impressions for this film.
That's literally covering just like a two and a half-week period.
That's only online — no print, no TV.
The film hasn't even been distributed yet.
It's not even online. It's not even streaming. It's not even been out into other foreign countries yet.
So ultimately, this film has already started to gain a lot of momentum.
And not bad for a project that almost every ad agency we talked to advised their clients not to take part.
What I always believe is that if you take chances, if you take risks, that in those risks will come opportunity.
I believe that when you push people away from that, you're pushing them more towards failure.
I believe that when you train your employees to be risk averse, then you're preparing your whole company to be reward challenged.
I feel like that what has to happen moving forward is we need to encourage people to take risks.
We need to encourage people to not be afraid of opportunities that may scare them.
Ultimately, moving forward, I think we have to embrace fear.
We've got to put that bear in a cage. (Laughter) Embrace fear. Embrace risk. One big spoonful at a time, we have to embrace risk.
And ultimately, we have to embrace transparency.
Today, more than ever, a little honesty is going to go a long way.
And that being said, through honesty and transparency, my entire talk, "Embrace Transparency," has been brought to you by my good friends at EMC, who for $7,100 bought the naming rights on eBay. (Applause) EMC: Turning big data into big opportunity for organizations all over the world.
EMC presents: "Embrace Transparency."
Thank you very much, guys.
(Applause)
June Cohen: So, Morgan, in the name of transparency, what exactly happened to that $7,100?
MS: That is a fantastic question.
I have in my pocket a check made out to the parent organization to the TED organization, the Sapling Foundation — a check for $7,100 to be applied toward my attendance for next year's TED.
(Laughter)
(Applause)
I have had the distinct blessing in my life to have worked on a bunch of amazing projects.
But the coolest I ever worked on was around this guy.
This guy's name is TEMPT.
TEMPT was one of the foremost graffiti artists in the 80s.
And he came up home from a run one day and said, "Dad, my legs are tingling." And that was the onset of ALS.
So TEMPT is now completely paralyzed.
He only has use of his eyes.
I was exposed to him. I have a company that does design and animation, so obviously graffiti is definitely an intricate part of what we admire and respect in the art world.
And so we decided that we were going to sponsor Tony, TEMPT, and his cause.
So I went and met with his brother and father and said, "We're going to give you this money. What are you going to do with it?" And his brother said, "I just want to be able to talk to Tony again.
I just want to be able to communicate with him and him to be able to communicate with me. "And I said," Wait a second, isn't that — I've seen Stephen Hawking — don't all paralyzed people have the ability to communicate via these devices? "And he said," No, unless you're in the upper echelon and you've got really amazing insurance, you can't actually do that.
These devices aren't accessible to people. "And I said," Well, how do you actually communicate? "Has everyone seen the movie" The Diving Bell and the Butterfly? "That's how they communicate — so run their finger along.
I said, "That's archaic.
How can that be? "
So I showed up with the desire to just write a check, and instead, I wrote a check that I had no freaking idea how I was going to cash.
I committed to his brother and his father right then and there — I'm like, "All right, here's the deal: Tony's going to speak, we're going to get him a machine, and we're going to figure out a way for him to do his art again.
Because it's a travesty that someone who still has all of that in him isn't able to communicate it. "
So I spoke at a conference a couple months after that.
I met these guys called GRL, Graffiti Research Lab, and they have a technology that allows them to project a light onto any surface and then, with a laser pointer, draw on it, and it just registers the negative space.
So they go around and do art installations like this.
All the things that go up there, they said there's a life cycle.
First it starts with the sexual organs, then it starts with cuss words, then it was Bush slanders and then people actually got to art.
But there was always a life cycle to their presentations.
So I went home and was having dinner with my wife and was telling her about this, and we were like, "Well wait a second. If we know that this technology exists where you can use your eyes to control things, why don't we figure out a way for TEMPT to control a laser and he could do graf again? Well that would be awesome."
So that started the journey.
And about two years later, about a year later, after a bunch of organization and a bunch of moving things around, we'd accomplished a couple things.
One, we battered down the doors of the insurance companies, and we actually got TEMPT a machine that let him communicate — a Stephen Hawking machine. (Applause) Which was awesome.
And he's seriously one of the funniest — I call him Yoda, because you talk to the guy, you get an email from him, and you're like, "I'm not worthy. This guy's so amazing."
The other thing we did is we flew seven programmers from all over the world — literally every corner of the world — into our house.
My wife and kids and I moved to our back garage, and these hackers and programmers and conspiracy theorists and anarchists took over our house.
A lot of our friends thought we were absolutely stupid to do that and that we were going to come back and all the pictures on the wall would be removed and graf on the walls.
But for over two weeks, we programmed, we went to the Venice boardwalk, my kids got involved, my dog got involved, and we created this.
This is called the EyeWriter, and you can see the description.
This is a cheap pair of sunglasses that we bought at the Venice Beach boardwalk, some copper wire and some stuff from Home Depot and Radio Shack.
We took a PS3 camera, hacked it open, mounted it to an LED light, and now there's a device that is free — you build this yourself, we publish the code for free, you download the software for free.
And now we've created a device that has absolutely no limitations.
There's no insurance company that can say "No." There's no hospital that can say "No." Anybody who's paralyzed now has access to actually draw or communicate using only their eyes.
(Applause)
Thank you. Thank you guys very much. That was awesome.
So at the end of the two weeks, we went back to TEMPT's room.
I love this picture, because this is someone else's room and that's his room.
So there's all this hustle and bustle going on for the big unveiling. And after over a year of planning, two weeks of programming, carb-fest and all-night sessions, Tony drew again for the first time in seven years.
And this is an amazing picture, because this is his life support system, and he's looking over his life support system.
We kicked his bed so that he could see out.
And we set up a projector on a wall out in the parking lot outside of his hospital.
And he drew again for the first time, in front of his family and friends — and you can only imagine what the feeling in the parking lot was.
The funny thing was, we had to break into the parking lot too, so we totally felt like we were legit in the whole graf scene too.
(Laughter)
So at the end of this, he sent us an email, and this is what the email said: "That was the first time I've drawn anything for seven years.
I feel like I had been held underwater, and someone finally reached down and pulled my head up so I could breathe. "Isn't that awesome?
(Applause)
So that's kind of our battle cry.
That's what keeps us going and keeps us developing.
And we've got such a long way to go with this.
This is an amazing device, but it's the equivalent of an Etch A Sketch.
And someone who has that kind of artistic potential deserves so much more.
So we're in the process of trying to figure out how to make it better, faster, stronger.
Since that time, we've had all kinds of acknowledgment.
We've won a bunch of awards.
Remember, it's free; none of us are making any money on this thing.
It's all coming out of our own pockets.
So the awards were like, "Oh, this is fantastic." Armstrong Twittered about us, and then in December, Time magazine honored us as one of the top 50 inventions of 2010, which was really cool.
(Applause)
The coolest thing about this — and this is what's completing the whole circle — is that in April of this year, at the Geffen MOCA in downtown Los Angeles, there's going to be an exhibition called "Art of the Streets." And "Art of the Streets" is going to have pretty much the bad-asses of the street art scene — Banksy, Shepard Fairey, KAWS — all of these guys will be there.
TEMPT's going to be in the show, which is pretty awesome.
(Applause)
So basically this is my point: If you see something that's not possible, make it possible.
Everything in this room wasn't possible — this stage, this computer, this mic, the EyeWriter — wasn't possible at one point.
Make it possible, everyone in this room.
I'm not a programmer, never done anything with ocular recognition technology, but I just recognized something and associated myself with amazing people so that we could make something happen.
And this is the question I want everyone to ask yourself every single day when you come up with something you feel that needs to be done: if not now, then when?
And if not me, then who?
Thank you guys.
(Applause)
How would you like to be better than you are?
Suppose I said that, with just a few changes in your genes, you could get a better memory — more precise, more accurate and quicker.
Or maybe you'd like to be more fit, stronger, with more stamina.
Would you like to be more attractive and self-confident?
How about living longer with good health?
Or perhaps you're one of those who's always yearned for more creativity.
Which one would you like the most?
Which would you like, if you could have just one? (Audience Member: Creativity.) Creativity.
How many people would choose creativity? Raise your hands. Let me see. A few. Probably about as many as there are creative people here. (Laughter) That's very good.
How many would opt for memory?
Quite a few more. How about fitness? A few less. What about longevity? Ah, the majority.
That makes me feel very good as a doctor.
If you could have any one of these, it would be a very different world.
Is it just imaginary?
Or, is it, perhaps, possible?
Evolution has been a perennial topic here at the TED Conference, but I want to give you today one doctor's take on the subject.
The great 20th-century geneticist, T.G. Dobzhansky, who was also a communicant in the Russian Orthodox Church, once wrote an essay that he titled "Nothing in Biology Makes Sense Except in the Light of Evolution." Now if you are one of those who does not accept the evidence for biological evolution, this would be a very good time to turn off your hearing aid, take out your personal communications device — I give you permission — and perhaps take another look at Kathryn Schultz's book on being wrong, because nothing in the rest of this talk is going to make any sense whatsoever to you. (Laughter) But if you do accept biological evolution, consider this: is it just about the past, or is it about the future?
Does it apply to others, or does it apply to us?
This is another look at the tree of life.
In this picture, I've put a bush with a center branching out in all directions, because if you look at the edges of the tree of life, every existing species at the tips of those branches has succeeded in evolutionary terms: it has survived; it has demonstrated a fitness to its environment.
The human part of this branch, way out on one end, is, of course, the one that we are most interested in.
We branch off of a common ancestor to modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago.
In the interval, there have been perhaps 20 or 25 different species of hominids.
Some have come and gone.
We have been here for about 130,000 years.
It may seem like we're quite remote from other parts of this tree of life, but actually, for the most part, the basic machinery of our cells is pretty much the same.
Do you realize that we can take advantage and commandeer the machinery of a common bacterium to produce the protein of human insulin used to treat diabetics?
This is not like human insulin; this is the same protein that is chemically indistinguishable from what comes out of your pancreas.
And speaking of bacteria, do you realize that each of us carries in our gut more bacteria than there are cells in the rest of our body?
Maybe 10 times more.
I mean think of it, when Antonio Damasio asks about your self-image, do you think about the bacteria?
Our gut is a wonderfully hospitable environment for those bacteria.
It's warm, it's dark, it's moist, it's very cozy.
And you're going to provide all the nutrition that they could possibly want with no effort on their part.
It's really like an Easy Street for bacteria, with the occasional interruption of the unintended forced rush to the exit.
But otherwise, you are a wonderful environment for those bacteria, just as they are essential to your life.
They help in the digestion of essential nutrients, and they protect you against certain diseases.
But what will come in the future?
Are we at some kind of evolutionary equipoise as a species?
Or, are we destined to become something different — something, perhaps, even better adapted to the environment?
Now let's take a step back in time to the Big Bang, 14 billion years ago — the Earth, the solar system, about four and a half billion years — the first signs of proto-life, maybe three to four billion years ago on Earth — the first multi-celled organisms, perhaps as much as 800 or a billion years ago — and then the human species, finally emerging in the last 130,000 years.
In this vast unfinished symphony of the universe, life on Earth is like a brief measure; the animal kingdom, like a single measure; and human life, a small grace note. That was us. That also constitutes the entertainment portion of this talk, so I hope you enjoyed it.
(Laughter)
Now when I was a freshman in college, I took my first biology class.
I was fascinated by the elegance and beauty of biology.
I became enamored of the power of evolution, and I realized something very fundamental: in most of the existence of life in single-celled organisms, each cell simply divides, and all of the genetic energy of that cell is carried on in both daughter cells.
But at the time multi-celled organisms come online, things start to change.
Sexual reproduction enters the picture.
And very importantly, with the introduction of sexual reproduction that passes on the genome, the rest of the body becomes expendable.
In fact, you could say that the inevitability of the death of our bodies enters in evolutionary time at the same moment as sexual reproduction.
Now I have to confess, when I was a college undergraduate, I thought, okay, sex / death, sex / death, death for sex — it seemed pretty reasonable at the time, but with each passing year, I've come to have increasing doubts.
I've come to understand the sentiments of George Burns, who was performing still in Las Vegas well into his 90s.
And one night, there's a knock at his hotel room door.
He answers the door.
Standing before him is a gorgeous, scantily clad showgirl.
She looks at him and says, "I'm here for super sex." "That's fine," says George, "I'll take the soup."
(Laughter)
I came to realize, as a physician, that I was working toward a goal which was different from the goal of evolution — not necessarily contradictory, just different.
I was trying to preserve the body.
I wanted to keep us healthy.
I wanted to restore health from disease.
I wanted us to live long and healthy lives.
Evolution is all about passing on the genome to the next generation, adapting and surviving through generation after generation.
From an evolutionary point of view, you and I are like the booster rockets designed to send the genetic payload into the next level of orbit and then drop off into the sea.
I think we would all understand the sentiment that Woody Allen expressed when he said, "I don't want to achieve immortality through my work.
I want to achieve it through not dying. "
(Laughter)
Evolution does not necessarily favor the longest-lived.
It doesn't necessarily favor the biggest or the strongest or the fastest, and not even the smartest.
Evolution favors those creatures best adapted to their environment.
That is the sole test of survival and success. At the bottom of the ocean, bacteria that are thermophilic and can survive at the steam vent heat that would otherwise produce, if fish were there, sous-vide cooked fish, nevertheless, have managed to make that a hospitable environment for them.
So what does this mean, as we look back at what has happened in evolution, and as we think about the place again of humans in evolution, and particularly as we look ahead to the next phase, I would say that there are a number of possibilities.
The first is that we will not evolve.
We have reached a kind of equipoise.
And the reasoning behind that would be, first, we have, through medicine, managed to preserve a lot of genes that would otherwise be selected out and be removed from the population.
And secondly, we as a species have so configured our environment that we have managed to make it adapt to us as well as we adapt to it. And by the way, we immigrate and circulate and intermix so much that you can't any longer have the isolation that is necessary for evolution to take place.
A second possibility is that there will be evolution of the traditional kind, natural, imposed by the forces of nature.
And the argument here would be that the wheels of evolution grind slowly, but they are inexorable.
And as far as isolation goes, when we as a species do colonize distant planets, there will be the isolation and the environmental changes that could produce evolution in the natural way.
But there's a third possibility, an enticing, intriguing and frightening possibility. I call it neo-evolution — the new evolution that is not simply natural, but guided and chosen by us as individuals in the choices that we will make.
Now how could this come about?
How could it be possible that we would do this?
Consider, first, the reality that people today, in some cultures, are making choices about their offspring.
They're, in some cultures, choosing to have more males than females.
It's not necessarily good for the society, but it's what the individual and the family are choosing.
Think also, if it were possible ever for you to choose, not simply to choose the sex of your child, but for you in your body to make the genetic adjustments that would cure or prevent diseases.
What if you could make the genetic changes to eliminate diabetes or Alzheimer's or reduce the risk of cancer or eliminate stroke?
Wouldn't you want to make those changes in your genes?
If we look ahead, these kind of changes are going to be increasingly possible.
The Human Genome Project started in 1990, and it took 13 years.
It cost 2.7 billion dollars.
The year after it was finished in 2004, you could do the same job for 20 million dollars in three to four months.
Today, you can have a complete sequence of the three billion base pairs in the human genome at a cost of about 20,000 dollars and in the space of about a week.
It won't be very long before the reality will be the 1,000-dollar human genome, and it will be increasingly available for everyone.
Just a week ago, the National Academy of Engineering awarded its Draper Prize to Francis Arnold and Willem Stemmer, two scientists who independently developed techniques to encourage the natural process of evolution to work faster and to lead to desirable proteins in a more efficient way — what Frances Arnold calls "directed evolution." A couple of years ago, the Lasker Prize was awarded to the scientist Shinya Yamanaka for his research in which he took an adult skin cell, a fibroblast, and by manipulating just four genes, he induced that cell to revert to a pluripotential stem cell — a cell potentially capable of becoming any cell in your body.
These changes are coming. The same technology that has produced the human insulin in bacteria can make viruses that will not only protect you against themselves, but induce immunity against other viruses.
Believe it or not, there's an experimental trial going on with vaccine against influenza that has been grown in the cells of a tobacco plant.
Can you imagine something good coming out of tobacco?
These are all reality today, and [in] the future, will be evermore possible.
Imagine then just two other little changes.
You can change the cells in your body, but what if you could change the cells in your offspring?
What if you could change the sperm and the ova, or change the newly fertilized egg, and give your offspring a better chance at a healthier life — eliminate the diabetes, eliminate the hemophilia, reduce the risk of cancer?
Who doesn't want healthier children?
And then, that same analytic technology, that same engine of science that can produce the changes to prevent disease, will also enable us to adopt super-attributes, hyper-capacities — that better memory.
Why not have the quick wit of a Ken Jennings, especially if you can augment it with the next generation of the Watson machine?
Why not have the quick twitch muscle that will enable you to run faster and longer?
Why not live longer?
These will be irresistible.
And when we are at a position where we can pass it on to the next generation, and we can adopt the attributes we want, we will have converted old-style evolution into neo-evolution.
We'll take a process that normally might require 100,000 years, and we can compress it down to a thousand years — and maybe even in the next 100 years.
These are choices that your grandchildren, or their grandchildren, are going to have before them.
Will we use these choices to make a society that is better, that is more successful, that is kinder?
Or, will we selectively choose different attributes that we want for some of us and not for others of us?
Will we make a society that is more boring and more uniform, or more robust and more versatile?
These are the kinds of questions that we will have to face.
And most profoundly of all, will we ever be able to develop the wisdom, and to inherit the wisdom, that we'll need to make these choices wisely?
For better or worse, and sooner than you may think, these choices will be up to us.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Good afternoon, everybody. I've got something to show you. (Laughter) Think about this as a pixel, a flying pixel.
This is what we call, in our lab, sensible design.
Let me tell you a bit about it.
Now if you take this picture — I'm Italian originally, and every boy in Italy grows up with this picture on the wall of his bedroom — but the reason I'm showing you this is that something very interesting happened in Formula 1 racing over the past couple of decades.
Now some time ago, if you wanted to win a Formula 1 race, you take a budget, and you bet your budget on a good driver and a good car.
And if the car and the driver were good enough, then you'd win the race.
Now today, if you want to win the race, actually you need also something like this — something that monitors the car in real time, has a few thousand sensors collecting information from the car, transmitting this information into the system, and then processing it and using it in order to go back to the car with decisions and changing things in real time as information is collected.
This is what, in engineering terms, you would call a real time control system.
And basically, it's a system made of two components — a sensing and an actuating component.
What is interesting today is that real time control systems are starting to enter into our lives.
Our cities, over the past few years, just have been blanketed with networks, electronics.
They're becoming like computers in open air.
And, as computers in open air, they're starting to respond in a different way to be able to be sensed and to be actuated.
If we fix cities, actually it's a big deal.
Just as an aside, I wanted to mention, cities are only two percent of the Earth's crust, but they are 50 percent of the world's population.
They are 75 percent of the energy consumption — up to 80 percent of CO2 emissions.
So if we're able to do something with cities, that's a big deal.
Beyond cities, all of this sensing and actuating is entering our everyday objects.
That's from an exhibition that Paola Antonelli is organizing at MoMA later this year, during the summer.
It's called "Talk to Me." Well our objects, our environment is starting to talk back to us.
In a certain sense, it's almost as if every atom out there were becoming both a sensor and an actuator.
And that is radically changing the interaction we have as humans with the environment out there.
In a certain sense, it's almost as if the old dream of Michelangelo... you know, when Michelangelo sculpted the Moses, at the end it said that he took the hammer, threw it at the Moses — actually you can still see a small chip underneath — and said, shouted, "Perché non parli?
Why don't you talk? "Well today, for the first time, our environment is starting to talk back to us.
And I'll show just a few examples — again, with this idea of sensing our environment and actuating it.
Let's starting with sensing.
Well, the first project I wanted to share with you is actually one of the first projects by our lab.
It was four and a half years ago in Italy.
And what we did there was actually use a new type of network at the time that had been deployed all across the world — that's a cellphone network — and use anonymous and aggregated information from that network, that's collected anyway by the operator, in order to understand how the city works.
The summer was a lucky summer — 2006.
It's when Italy won the soccer World Cup.
Some of you might remember, it was Italy and France playing, and then Zidane at the end, the headbutt.
And anyway, Italy won at the end.
(Laughter)
Now look at what happened that day just by monitoring activity happening on the network.
Here you see the city.
You see the Colosseum in the middle, the river Tiber.
It's morning, before the match.
You see the timeline on the top.
Early afternoon, people here and there, making calls and moving.
The match begins — silence. France scores. Italy scores. Halftime, people make a quick call and go to the bathroom. Second half. End of normal time.
First overtime, second.
Zidane, the headbutt in a moment. Italy wins. Yeah. (Laughter) (Applause) Well, that night, everybody went to celebrate in the center.
You saw the big peak.
The following day, again everybody went to the center to meet the winning team and the prime minister at the time.
And then everybody moved down.
You see the image of the place called Circo Massimo, where, since Roman times, people go to celebrate, to have a big party, and you see the peak at the end of the day.
Well, that's just one example of how we can sense the city today in a way that we couldn't have done just a few years ago.
Another quick example about sensing: it's not about people, but about things we use and consume.
Well today, we know everything about where our objects come from.
This is a map that shows you all the chips that form a Mac computer, how they came together.
But we know very little about where things go.
So in this project, we actually developed some small tags to track trash as it moves through the system.
So we actually started with a number of volunteers who helped us in Seattle, just over a year ago, to tag what they were throwing away — different types of things, as you can see here — things they would throw away anyway.
Then we put a little chip, little tag, onto the trash and then started following it.
Here are the results we just obtained.
(Music)
From Seattle... after one week.
With this information we realized there's a lot of inefficiencies in the system.
We can actually do the same thing with much less energy.
This data was not available before.
But there's a lot of wasted transportation and convoluted things happening.
But the other thing is that we believe that if we see every day that the cup we're throwing away, it doesn't disappear, it's still somewhere on the planet.
And the plastic bottle we're throwing away every day still stays there.
And if we show that to people, then we can also promote some behavioral change.
So that was the reason for the project.
My colleague at MIT, Assaf Biderman, he could tell you much more about sensing and many other wonderful things we can do with sensing, but I wanted to go to the second part we discussed at the beginning, and that's actuating our environment.
And the first project is something we did a couple of years ago in Zaragoza, Spain.
It started with a question by the mayor of the city, who came to us saying that Spain and Southern Europe have a beautiful tradition of using water in public space, in architecture.
And the question was: How could technology, new technology, be added to that?
And one of the ideas that was developed at MIT in a workshop was, imagine this pipe, and you've got valves, solenoid valves, taps, opening and closing.
You create like a water curtain with pixels made of water.
If those pixels fall, you can write on it, you can show patterns, images, text.
And even you can approach it, and it will open up to let you jump through, as you see in this image.
Well, we presented this to Mayor Belloch.
He liked it very much.
And we got a commission to design a building at the entrance of the expo.
We called it Digital Water Pavilion.
The whole building is made of water.
There's no doors or windows, but when you approach it, it will open up to let you in. (Music) The roof also is covered with water.
And if there's a bit of wind, if you want to minimize splashing, you can actually lower the roof.
Or you could close the building, and the whole architecture will disappear, like in this case.
You know, these days, you always get images during the winter, when they take the roof down, of people who have been there and said, "They demolished the building." No, they didn't demolish it, just when it goes down, the architecture almost disappears.
Here's the building working.
You see the person puzzled about what was going on inside.
And here was myself trying not to get wet, testing the sensors that open the water.
Well, I should tell you now what happened one night when all of the sensors stopped working.
But actually that night, it was even more fun.
All the kids from Zaragoza came to the building, because the way of engaging with the building became something different.
Not anymore a building that would open up to let you in, but a building that would still make cuts and holes through the water, and you had to jump without getting wet.
(Video) (Crowd Noise)
And that was, for us, was very interesting, because, as architects, as engineers, as designers, we always think about how people will use the things we design.
But then reality's always unpredictable.
And that's the beauty of doing things that are used and interact with people.
Here is an image then of the building with the physical pixels, the pixels made of water, and then projections on them.
And this is what led us to think about the following project I'll show you now.
That's, imagine those pixels could actually start flying.
Imagine you could have small helicopters that move in the air, and then each of them with a small pixel in changing lights — almost as a cloud that can move in space.
Here is the video.
(Music)
So imagine one helicopter, like the one we saw before, moving with others, in synchrony.
So you can have this cloud.
You can have a kind of flexible screen or display, like this — a regular configuration in two dimensions.
Or in regular, but in three dimensions, where the thing that changes is the light, not the pixels' position.
You can play with a different type.
Imagine your screen could just appear in different scales or sizes, different types of resolution.
But then the whole thing can be just a 3D cloud of pixels that you can approach and move through it and see from many, many directions.
Here is the real Flyfire control and going down to form the regular grid as before.
When you turn on the light, actually you see this.
So the same as we saw before.
And imagine each of them then controlled by people.
You can have each pixel having an input that comes from people, from people's movement, or so and so.
I want to show you something here for the first time.
We've been working with Roberto Bolle, one of today's top ballet dancers — the étoile at Metropolitan in New York and La Scala in Milan — and actually captured his movement in 3D in order to use it as an input for Flyfire.
And here you can see Roberto dancing.
You see on the left the pixels, the different resolutions being captured.
It's both 3D scanning in real time and motion capture.
So you can reconstruct a whole movement.
You can go all the way through.
But then, once we have the pixels, then you can play with them and play with color and movement and gravity and rotation.
So we want to use this as one of the possible inputs for Flyfire.
I wanted to show you the last project we are working on.
It's something we're working on for the London Olympics.
It's called The Cloud.
And the idea here is, imagine, again, we can involve people in doing something and changing our environment — almost to impart what we call cloud raising — like barn raising, but with a cloud.
Imagine you can have everybody make a small donation for one pixel.
And I think what is remarkable that has happened over the past couple of years is that, over the past couple of decades, we went from the physical world to the digital one.
This has been digitizing everything, knowledge, and making that accessible through the Internet.
Now today, for the first time — and the Obama campaign showed us this — we can go from the digital world, from the self-organizing power of networks, to the physical one.
This can be, in our case, we want to use it for designing and doing a symbol.
That means something built in a city.
But tomorrow it can be, in order to tackle today's pressing challenges — think about climate change or CO2 emissions — how we can go from the digital world to the physical one.
So the idea that we can actually involve people in doing this thing together, collectively.
The cloud is a cloud, again, made of pixels, in the same way as the real cloud is a cloud made of particles.
And those particles are water, where our cloud is a cloud of pixels.
It's a physical structure in London, but covered with pixels.
You can move inside, have different types of experiences.
You can actually see from underneath, sharing the main moments for the Olympics in 2012 and beyond, and really using it as a way to connect with the community.
So both the physical cloud in the sky and something you can go to the top [of], like London's new mountaintop. You can enter inside it. And a kind of new digital beacon for the night — but most importantly, a new type of experience for anybody who will go to the top.
Thank you.
(Applause)
My name is Amit. And 18 months ago, I had another job at Google, and I pitched this idea of doing something with museums and art to my boss who's actually here, and she allowed me to do it.
And it took 18 months.
A lot of fun, negotiations and stories, I can tell you, with 17 very interesting museums from nine countries.
But I'm going to focus on the demo.
There are a lot of stories about why we did this.
I think my personal story is explained very simply on the slide, and it's access.
And I grew up in India.
I had a great education — I'm not complaining — but I didn't have access to a lot of these museums and these artworks.
And so when I started traveling and going to these museums, I started learning a lot.
And while working at Google, I tried to put this desire to make it more accessible with technology together.
So we formed a team, a great team of people, and we started doing this.
I'm going to probably get into the demo and then tell you a couple of the interesting things we've had since launch.
So, simple: you come to GoogleArtProject.com. You look around at all these museums here.
You've got the Uffizi, you've got the MoMA, the Hermitage, the Rijks, the Van Gogh.
I'm going to actually get to one of my favorites, the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.
Two ways of going in — very simple.
Click and, bang, you're in this museum.
It doesn't matter where you are — Bombay, Mexico, it doesn't really matter.
You move around, you have fun.
You want to navigate around the museum?
Open the plan up, and, in one click, jump.
You're in there, you want to go to the end of the corridor. Keep going. Have fun. Explore.
(Applause)
Thanks. I haven't come to the best part.
(Laughter)
So now I'm in front of one of my favorite paintings, "The Harvesters" by Pieter Bruegel at the Met.
I see this plus sign.
If the museum has given us the image, you click on it.
Now this is one of the images.
So this is all of the meta-data information.
For those of you who are truly interested in art, you can click this — but I'm going to click this off right now.
And this is one of these images that we captured in what we call gigapixel technology.
So this image, for example, has close to, I think, around 10 billion pixels.
And I get a lot of people asking me: "What do you get for 10 billion pixels?" So I'm going to try and show you what you really get for 10 billion pixels. You can zoom around very simply.
You see some fun stuff happening here.
I love this guy; his expression is priceless.
But then you really want to go deep.
And so I started playing around, and I found something going on over here.
And I was like, "Hold on. That sounds interesting." Went in, and I started noticing that these kids were actually beating something.
I did a little research, spoke to a couple of my contacts at the Met, and actually found out that this is a game called squall, which involves beating a goose with a stick on Shrove Tuesday.
And apparently it was quite popular.
I don't know why they did it, but I learned something about it.
Now just to get really deep in, you can really get to the cracks.
Now just to give you some perspective, I'm going to zoom out so you really see what you get.
Here is where we were, and this is the painting.
(Applause)
The best is yet to come — so in a second.
So now let's just quickly jump into the MoMA, again in New York.
So another one of my favorites, "The Starry Night." Now the example I showed you was all about finding details.
But what if you want to see brush strokes?
And what if you want to see how Van Gogh actually created this masterpiece? You zoom in. You really go in.
I'm going to go to one of my favorite parts in this painting, and I'm really going to get to the cracks.
This is "The Starry Night," I think, never seen like this before.
I'm going to show you my other favorite feature.
There's a lot of other stuff here, but I don't have time.
This is the real cool part. It's called Collections.
Any one of you, anybody — doesn't matter if you're rich, if you're poor, if you have a fancy house — doesn't matter.
You can go and create your own museum online — create your own collection across all these images.
Very simply, you go in — and I've created this, called The Power of Zoom — you can just zoom around.
This is "The Ambassadors," based in the National Gallery.
You can annotate the stuff, send it to your friends and really get a conversation going about what you're feeling when you go through these masterpieces.
So I think, in conclusion, for me, the main thing is that all the amazing stuff here does not really come from Google.
It doesn't, in my opinion, even come from the museums.
I probably shouldn't say that.
It really comes from these artists.
And that's been my humbling experience in this.
I mean, I hope in this digital medium that we do justice to their artwork and represent it properly online.
And the biggest question I get asked nowadays is, "Did you do this to replicate the experience of going to a museum?" And the answer is no.
It's to supplement the experience.
And that's it. Thank you.
(Applause)
Thank you.
This is a representation of your brain, and your brain can be broken into two parts.
There's the left half, which is the logical side, and then the right half, which is the intuitive.
And so if we had a scale to measure the aptitude of each hemisphere, then we can plot our brain.
And for example, this would be somebody who's completely logical.
This would be someone who's entirely intuitive.
So where would you put your brain on this scale?
Some of us may have opted for one of these extremes, but I think for most people in the audience, your brain is something like this — with a high aptitude in both hemispheres at the same time.
It's not like they're mutually exclusive or anything.
You can be logical and intuitive.
And so I consider myself one of these people, along with most of the other experimental quantum physicists, who need a good deal of logic to string together these complex ideas.
But at the same time, we need a good deal of intuition to actually make the experiments work.
How do we develop this intuition?
Well we like to play with stuff.
So we go out and play with it, and then we see how it acts, and then we develop our intuition from there.
And really you do the same thing.
So some intuition that you may have developed over the years is that one thing is only in one place at a time.
I mean, it can sound weird to think about one thing being in two different places at the same time, but you weren't born with this notion, you developed it.
And I remember watching a kid playing on a car stop.
He was just a toddler and he wasn't very good at it, and he kept falling over.
But I bet playing with this car stop taught him a really valuable lesson, and that's that large things don't let you get right past them, and that they stay in one place.
And so this is a great conceptual model to have of the world, unless you're a particle physicist.
It'd be a terrible model for a particle physicist, because they don't play with car stops, they play with these little weird particles.
And when they play with their particles, they find they do all sorts of really weird things — like they can fly right through walls, or they can be in two different places at the same time.
And so they wrote down all these observations, and they called it the theory of quantum mechanics.
And so that's where physics was at a few years ago; you needed quantum mechanics to describe little, tiny particles.
But you didn't need it to describe the large, everyday objects around us.
This didn't really sit well with my intuition, and maybe it's just because I don't play with particles very often.
Well, I play with them sometimes, but not very often.
And I've never seen them.
I mean, nobody's ever seen a particle.
But it didn't sit well with my logical side either.
Because if everything is made up of little particles and all the little particles follow quantum mechanics, then shouldn't everything just follow quantum mechanics?
I don't see any reason why it shouldn't.
And so I'd feel a lot better about the whole thing if we could somehow show that an everyday object also follows quantum mechanics.
So a few years ago, I set off to do just that.
So I made one. This is the first object that you can see that has been in a mechanical quantum superposition.
So what we're looking at here is a tiny computer chip.
And you can sort of see this green dot right in the middle.
And that's this piece of metal I'm going to be talking about in a minute.
This is a photograph of the object.
And here I'll zoom in a little bit.
We're looking right there in the center.
And then here's a really, really big close-up of the little piece of metal.
So what we're looking at is a little chunk of metal, and it's shaped like a diving board, and it's sticking out over a ledge.
And so I made this thing in nearly the same way as you make a computer chip.
I went into a clean room with a fresh silicon wafer, and then I just cranked away at all the big machines for about 100 hours.
For the last stuff, I had to build my own machine — to make this swimming pool-shaped hole underneath the device.
This device has the ability to be in a quantum superposition, but it needs a little help to do it.
Here, let me give you an analogy.
You know how uncomfortable it is to be in a crowded elevator?
I mean, when I'm in an elevator all alone, I do all sorts of weird things, but then other people get on board and I stop doing those things because I don't want to bother them, or, frankly, scare them.
So quantum mechanics says that inanimate objects feel the same way.
The fellow passengers for inanimate objects are not just people, but it's also the light shining on it and the wind blowing past it and the heat of the room.
And so we knew, if we wanted to see this piece of metal behave quantum mechanically, we're going to have to kick out all the other passengers.
And so that's what we did.
We turned off the lights, and then we put it in a vacuum and sucked out all the air, and then we cooled it down to just a fraction of a degree above absolute zero.
Now, all alone in the elevator, the little chunk of metal is free to act however it wanted.
And so we measured its motion.
We found it was moving in really weird ways.
Instead of just sitting perfectly still, it was vibrating, and the way it was vibrating was breathing something like this — like expanding and contracting bellows.
And by giving it a gentle nudge, we were able to make it both vibrate and not vibrate at the same time — something that's only allowed with quantum mechanics.
So what I'm telling you here is something truly fantastic.
What does it mean for one thing to be both vibrating and not vibrating at the same time?
So let's think about the atoms.
So in one case: all the trillions of atoms that make up that chunk of metal are sitting still and at the same time those same atoms are moving up and down.
Now it's only at precise times when they align.
The rest of the time they're delocalized.
That means that every atom is in two different places at the same time, which in turn means the entire chunk of metal is in two different places.
I think this is really cool. (Laughter) Really.
(Applause)
It was worth locking myself in a clean room to do this for all those years because, check this out, the difference in scale between a single atom and that chunk of metal is about the same as the difference between that chunk of metal and you.
So if a single atom can be in two different places at the same time, that chunk of metal can be in two different places, then why not you?
I mean, this is just my logical side talking.
So imagine if you're in multiple places at the same time, what would that be like?
How would your consciousness handle your body being delocalized in space?
There's one more part to the story.
It's when we warmed it up, and we turned on the lights and looked inside the box, we saw that the piece metal was still there in one piece.
And so I had to develop this new intuition, that it seems like all the objects in the elevator are really just quantum objects just crammed into a tiny space.
You hear a lot of talk about how quantum mechanics says that everything is all interconnected.
Well, that's not quite right. It's more than that; it's deeper.
It's that those connections, your connections to all the things around you, literally define who you are, and that's the profound weirdness of quantum mechanics.
Thank you.
(Applause)
I'm Jessi, and this is my suitcase.
But before I show you what I've got inside, I'm going to make a very public confession, and that is, I'm outfit-obsessed.
I love finding, wearing, and more recently, photographing and blogging a different, colorful, crazy outfit for every single occasion.
But I don't buy anything new.
I get all my clothes secondhand from flea markets and thrift stores.
Aww, thank you.
Secondhand shopping allows me to reduce the impact my wardrobe has on the environment and on my wallet.
I get to meet all kinds of great people; my dollars usually go to a good cause; I look pretty unique; and it makes shopping like my own personal treasure hunt.
I mean, what am I going to find today?
Is it going to be my size?
Will I like the color?
Will it be under $20?
If all the answers are yes, I feel as though I've won.
I want to get back to my suitcase and tell you what I packed for this exciting week here at TED.
I mean, what does somebody with all these outfits bring with her?
So I'm going to show you exactly what I brought.
I brought seven pairs of underpants and that's it.
Exactly one week's worth of undies is all I put in my suitcase.
I was betting that I'd be able to find everything else I could possible want to wear once I got here to Palm Springs.
And since you don't know me as the woman walking around TED in her underwear — (Laughter) that means I found a few things.
And I'd really love to show you my week's worth of outfits right now.
Does that sound good? (Applause) So as I do this, I'm also going to tell you a few of the life lessons that, believe it or not, I have picked up in these adventures wearing nothing new.
So let's start with Sunday.
I call this "Shiny Tiger." You do not have to spend a lot of money to look great.
You can almost always look phenomenal for under $50.
This whole outfit, including the jacket, cost me $55, and it was the most expensive thing that I wore the entire week.
Monday: Color is powerful.
It is almost physiologically impossible to be in a bad mood when you're wearing bright red pants. (Laughter) If you are happy, you are going to attract other happy people to you.
Tuesday: Fitting in is way overrated.
I've spent a whole lot of my life trying to be myself and at the same time fit in.
Just be who you are.
If you are surrounding yourself with the right people, they will not only get it, they will appreciate it.
Wednesday: Embrace your inner child.
Sometimes people tell me that I look like I'm playing dress-up, or that I remind them of their seven-year-old.
I like to smile and say, "Thank you."
Thursday: Confidence is key.
If you think you look good in something, you almost certainly do.
And if you don't think you look good in something, you're also probably right.
I grew up with a mom who taught me this day-in and day-out.
But it wasn't until I turned 30 that I really got what this meant.
And I'm going to break it down for you for just a second.
If you believe you're a beautiful person inside and out, there is no look that you can't pull off.
So there is no excuse for any of us here in this audience.
We should be able to rock anything we want to rock. Thank you.
(Applause)
Friday: A universal truth — five words for you: Gold sequins go with everything.
And finally, Saturday: Developing your own unique personal style is a really great way to tell the world something about you without having to say a word.
It's been proven to me time and time again as people have walked up to me this week simply because of what I'm wearing, and we've had great conversations.
So obviously this is not all going to fit back in my tiny suitcase.
So before I go home to Brooklyn, I'm going to donate everything back.
Because the lesson I'm trying to learn myself this week is that it's okay to let go.
I don't need to get emotionally attached to these things because around the corner, there is always going to be another crazy, colorful, shiny outfit just waiting for me, if I put a little love in my heart and look.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
Thank you.
In 2007, I decided that we needed to reconceptualize how we thought about economic development.
Our new goal should be that when every family thinks about where they want to live and work, they should be able to choose between at least a handful of different cities that were all competing to attract new residents.
Now we're a long way away from that goal right now.
There are billions of people in developing countries who don't have even a single city that would be willing to welcome them.
But the amazing thing about cities is they're worth so much more than it costs to build them.
So we could easily supply the world with dozens, maybe hundreds, of new cities.
Now this might sound preposterous to you if you've never thought about new cities.
But just substitute apartment building for cities.
Imagine half the people who wanted to be in apartments already had them; the other half aren't there yet.
You could try and expand the capacity by doing additions on all the existing apartments.
But you know what you'd run into is those apartments and the surrounding areas have rules to avoid discomfort and the distractions of construction.
So it's extremely hard to do all of those additions.
But you could go out someplace brand new, build a brand new apartment building, as long as the rules there were ones that facilitated construction rather than getting in the way.
So I proposed that governments create new reform zones big enough to hold cities and gave them a name: charter cities.
Later I learned that at about this same time, Javier and Octavio were thinking about the challenge of reform in Honduras.
They knew that about 75,000 Hondurans every year would leave to go to the United States, and they wanted to ask, what could they do to make sure that those people could stay and do the same things in Honduras.
At one point, Javier said to Octavio, "What if we took some of our empty land — what if we just gave it to an embassy — give some to the U.S. embassy; give some to the Canadian embassy — and then if people want to go work under the rules of Canada or under the rules of the United States, they can go get jobs, do everything they do on those embassy grounds that they would otherwise have to go to Canada or the U.S. to do?"
In the summer of 2009, Honduras went through a wrenching constitutional crisis.
At the next regularly scheduled election, Pepe Lobo won in a landslide on a platform that promised reform, but reconciliation as well.
He asked Octavio to be his chief of staff.
Meanwhile, I was getting ready to give a talk at TEDGlobal.
Through a process of refinement, trial and error, a lot of user testing, I tried to boil this complicated concept of charter city down to the bare essentials.
The first point was the importance of rules, like those rules that say you can't come in and disturb all the existing apartment holders.
We pay a lot of attention to new technologies, but it takes technologies and rules to get progress, and it's usually the rules that hold us back.
In the fall of 2010, a friend from Guatemala sent Octavio a link to the TEDTalk.
He showed it to Javier. They called me. They said, "Let's present this to the leaders of our country." So in December we met in Miami, in a hotel conference room.
I tried to explain this point about how valuable cities are, how much more valuable they are than they cost.
And I used this slide showing how valuable the raw land is in a place like New York City: notice, land that's worth thousands of dollars, in some cases, per square meter.
But it was a fairly abstract discussion, and at some point when there was a pause, Octavio said, "Paul, maybe we could watch the TEDTalk."
(Laughing)
So the TEDTalk laid out in very simple terms, a charter city is a place where you start with uninhabited land, a charter that specifies the rules that will apply there and then a chance for people to opt in, to go live under those rules or not.
So I was asked by the president of Honduras who said that we need to do this project, this is important, this could be the way forward for our country.
I was asked to come to Tegucigalpa and talk again on January fourth and fifth.
So I presented another fact-filled lecture that included a slide like this, which tried to make the point that, if you want to create a lot of value in a city, it has to be very big.
This is a picture of Denver, and the outline is the new airport that was built in Denver.
This airport alone covers more than 100 square kilometers.
So I was trying to persuade the Hondurans, if you build a new city, you've got to start with a site that's at least 1,000 square kilometers.
That's more than 250 hundred-thousand acres. Everybody applauded politely. The faces in the audience were very serious and attentive.
The leader of the congress came up on stage and said, "Professor Romer, thank you very much for your lecture, but maybe we could watch the TEDTalk.
I've got it here on my laptop. "So I sat down, and they played the TEDTalk.
And it got to the essence, which is that a new city could offer new choices for people.
There would be a choice of a city which you could go to which could be in Honduras, instead of hundreds of miles away in the North.
And it also involved new choices for leaders.
Because the leaders in the government there in Honduras would need help from partner countries, who could benefit from partner countries who help them set up the rules in this charter and the enforcement, so everybody can trust that the charter really will be enforced.
And the insight of President Lobo was that that assurance of enforcement that I was thinking about as a way to get the foreign investors to come in and build the city could be equally important for all the different parties in Honduras who had suffered for so many years from fear and distrust.
We went and looked at a site.
This picture's from there.
It easily could hold a thousand square kilometers.
And shortly thereafter, on January 19th, they voted in the congress to amend their constitution to have a constitutional provision that allows for special development regions.
In a country which had just gone through this wrenching crisis, the vote in the congress in favor of this constitutional amendment was 124 to one.
All parties, all factions in society, backed this.
To be part of the constitution, you actually have to pass it twice in the congress.
On February 17th they passed it again with another vote of 114 to one.
Immediately after that vote, on February 21st to the 24th, a delegation of about 30 Hondurans went to the two places in the world that are most interested in getting into the city building business.
One is South Korea.
This is a picture of a big, new city center that's being built in South Korea — bigger than downtown Boston.
Everything you see there was built in four years, after they spent four years getting the permits.
The other place that's very interested in city building is Singapore.
They've actually built two cities already in China and are preparing the third.
So if you think about this practically, here's where we are.
They've got a site; they're already thinking about this site for the second city.
They're putting in place a legal system that could allow for managers to come in, and also an external legal system.
One country has already volunteered to let its supreme court be the court of final appeal for the new judicial system there.
There's designers and builders of cities who are very interested.
They even can bring with them some financing.
But the one thing you know they've already solved is that there's lots of tenants.
There's lots of businesses that would like to locate in the Americas, especially in a place with a free trade zone, and there's lots of people who'd like to go there.
Around the world, there's 700 million people who say they'd like to move permanently someplace else right now.
There's a million a year who leave Latin America to go to the United States.
Many of these are a father who has to leave his family behind to go get a job — sometimes a single mother who has to get enough money to even pay for food or clothing.
Sadly, sometimes there are even children who are trying to get reunited with their parents that they haven't seen, in some cases, for a decade.
So what kind of an idea is it to think about building a brand new city in Honduras?
Or to build a dozen of these, or a hundred of these, around the world?
What kind of an idea is it to think about insisting that every family have a choice of several cities that are competing to attract new residents?
This is an idea worth spreading.
And my friends from Honduras asked me to say thank you, TED.
(Applause)
I want you to imagine two couples in the middle of 1979 on the exact same day, at the exact same moment, each conceiving a baby, OK?
So two couples each conceiving one baby.
Now I don't want you to spend too much time imagining the conception, because if you do, you're not going to listen to me, so just imagine that for a moment.
And in this scenario, I want to imagine that, in one case, the sperm is carrying a Y chromosome, meeting that X chromosome of the egg.
And in the other case, the sperm is carrying an X chromosome, meeting the X chromosome of the egg.
Both are viable; both take off.
We'll come back to these people later.
So I wear two hats in most of what I do.
As the one hat, I do history of anatomy.
I'm a historian by training, and what I study in that case is the way that people have dealt with anatomy — meaning human bodies, animal bodies — how they dealt with bodily fluids, concepts of bodies; how have they thought about bodies.
The other hat that I've worn in my work is as an activist, as a patient advocate — or, as I sometimes say, as an impatient advocate — for people who are patients of doctors.
In that case, what I've worked with is people who have body types that challenge social norms.
So some of what I've worked on, for example, is people who are conjoined twins — two people within one body.
Some of what I've worked on is people who have dwarfism — so people who are much shorter than typical.
And a lot of what I've worked on is people who have atypical sex — so people who don't have the standard male or the standard female body types.
And as a general term, we can use the term "intersex" for this.
Intersex comes in a lot of different forms.
I'll just give you a few examples of the types of ways you can have sex that isn't standard for male or female.
So in one instance, you can have somebody who has an XY chromosomal basis, and that SRY gene on the Y chromosome tells the proto-gonads, which we all have in the fetal life, to become testes.
So in the fetal life, those testes are pumping out testosterone.
But because this individual lacks receptors to hear that testosterone, the body doesn't react to the testosterone.
And this is a syndrome called androgen insensitivity syndrome.
So lots of levels of testosterone, but no reaction to it.
As a consequence, the body develops more along the female typical path.
When the child is born, she looks like a girl.
She is a girl, she is raised as a girl.
And it's often not until she hits puberty and she's growing and developing breasts, but she's not getting her period, that somebody figures out something's up here.
And they do some tests and figure out that, instead of having ovaries inside and a uterus, she has testes inside, and she has a Y chromosome.
Now what's important to understand is you may think of this person as really being male, but they're really not.
Females, like males, have in our bodies something called the adrenal glands.
They're in the back of our body.
And the adrenal glands make androgens, which are a masculinizing hormone.
Most females like me — I believe myself to be a typical female — I don't actually know my chromosomal make-up, but I think I'm probably typical — most females like me are actually androgen-sensitive.
We're making androgen, and we're responding to androgens.
The consequence is that somebody like me has actually had a brain exposed to more androgens than the woman born with testes who has androgen insensitivity syndrome.
So sex is really complicated — it's not just that intersex people are in the middle of all the sex spectrum — in some ways, they can be all over the place.
Another example: a few years ago I got a call from a man who was 19 years old, who was born a boy, raised a boy, had a girlfriend, had sex with his girlfriend, had a life as a guy, and had just found out that he had ovaries and a uterus inside.
What he had was an extreme form of a condition called congenital adrenal hyperplasia.
He had XX chromosomes, and in the womb, his adrenal glands were in such high gear that it created, essentially, a masculine hormonal environment.
And as a consequence, his genitals were masculinized, his brain was subject to the more typical masculine component of hormones.
And he was born looking like a boy — nobody suspected anything.
And it was only when he had reached the age of 19 that he began to have enough medical problems from menstruating internally, that doctors figured out that, in fact, he was female, internally.
OK, so just one more quick example of a way you can have intersex.
Some people who have XX chromosomes develop what are called ovotestis, which is when you have ovarian tissue with testicular tissue wrapped around it.
And we're not exactly sure why that happens.
So sex can come in lots of different varieties.
The reason that children with these kinds of bodies — whether it's dwarfism, or it's conjoined twinning, or it's an intersex type — are often "normalized" by surgeons is not because it actually leaves them better off in terms of physical health.
In many cases, people are actually perfectly healthy.
The reason they're often subject to various kinds of surgeries is because they threaten our social categories.
Our system has been based typically on the idea that a particular kind of anatomy comes with a particular identity.
So we have the concept that what it means to be a woman is to have a female identity; what it means to be a black person is, allegedly, to have an African anatomy in terms of your history.
And so we have this terribly simplistic idea.
And when we're faced with a body that actually presents us something quite different, it startles us in terms of those categorizations.
So we have a lot of very romantic ideas in our culture about individualism.
And our nation's really founded on a very romantic concept of individualism.
You can imagine how startling then it is when you have children who are born who are two people inside of one body. Where I ran into the most heat from this most recently was last year when South African runner, Caster Semenya, had her sex called into question at the International Games in Berlin.
I had a lot of journalists calling me, asking me, "Which is the test they're going to run that will tell us whether or not Caster Semenya is male or female?" And I had to explain to the journalists there isn't such a test.
In fact, we now know that sex is complicated enough that we have to admit: Nature doesn't draw the line for us between male and female, or between male and intersex and female and intersex; we actually draw that line on nature.
So what we have is a sort of situation where the farther our science goes, the more we have to admit to ourselves that these categories that we thought of as stable anatomical categories, that mapped very simply to stable identity categories are a lot more fuzzy than we thought.
And it's not just in terms of sex.
It's also in terms of race, which turns out to be vastly more complicated than our terminology has allowed.
As we look, we get into all sorts of uncomfortable areas.
We look, for example, about the fact that we share at least 95 percent of our DNA with chimpanzees.
What are we to make of the fact that we differ from them only, really, by a few nucleotides?
And as we get farther and farther with our science, we get more and more into a discomforted zone, where we have to acknowledge that the simplistic categories we've had are probably overly simplistic.
So we're seeing this in all sorts of places in human life.
One of the places we're seeing it, for example, in our culture, in the United States today, is battles over the beginning of life and the end of life.
We have difficult conversations about at what point we decide a body becomes a human, such that it has a different right than a fetal life.
We have very difficult conversations nowadays — probably not out in the open as much as within medicine — about the question of when somebody's dead.
In the past, our ancestors never had to struggle so much with this question of when somebody was dead.
At most, they'd stick a feather on somebody's nose, and if it twitched, they didn't bury them yet.
If it stopped twitching, you bury them.
But today, we have a situation where we want to take vital organs out of beings and give them to other beings.
And as a consequence, we have to struggle with this really difficult question about who's dead, and this leads us to a really difficult situation where we don't have such simple categories as we've had before.
Now you might think that all this breaking-down of categories would make somebody like me really happy.
I'm a political progressive, I defend people with unusual bodies, but I have to admit to you that it makes me nervous.
Understanding that these categories are really much more unstable than we thought makes me tense.
It makes me tense from the point of view of thinking about democracy.
So in order to tell you about that tension, I have to first admit to you a huge fan of the Founding Fathers.
I know they were racists, I know they were sexist, but they were great.
I mean, they were so brave and so bold and so radical in what they did, that I find myself watching that cheesy musical "1776" every few years, and it's not because of the music, which is totally forgettable.
It's because of what happened in 1776 with the Founding Fathers.
The Founding Fathers were, for my point of view, the original anatomical activists, and this is why.
What they rejected was an anatomical concept and replaced it with another one that was radical and beautiful and held us for 200 years.
So as you all recall, what our Founding Fathers were rejecting was a concept of monarchy, and the monarchy was basically based on a very simplistic concept of anatomy.
The monarchs of the old world didn't have a concept of DNA, but they did have a concept of birthright.
They had a concept of blue blood.
They had the idea that the people who would be in political power should be in political power because of the blood being passed down from grandfather to father to son and so forth.
The Founding Fathers rejected that idea, and they replaced it with a new anatomical concept, and that concept was "all men are created equal." They leveled that playing field and decided the anatomy that mattered was the commonality of anatomy, not the difference in anatomy, and that was a really radical thing to do.
Now they were doing it in part because they were part of an Enlightenment system where two things were growing up together.
And that was democracy growing up, but it was also science growing up at the same time.
And it's really clear, if you look at the history of the Founding Fathers, a lot of them were very interested in science, and they were interested in the concept of a naturalistic world.
They were moving away from supernatural explanations, and they were rejecting things like a supernatural concept of power, where it transmitted because of a very vague concept of birthright.
They were moving towards a naturalistic concept.
And if you look, for example, in the Declaration of Independence, they talk about nature and nature's God.
They don't talk about God and God's nature.
They're talking about the power of nature to tell us who we are.
So as part of that, they were coming to us with a concept that was about anatomical commonality.
And in doing so, they were really setting up in a beautiful way the Civil Rights Movement of the future.
They didn't think of it that way, but they did it for us, and it was great.
So what happened years afterwards?
What happened was women, for example, who wanted the right to vote, took the Founding Fathers' concept of anatomical commonality being more important than anatomical difference and said, "The fact that we have a uterus and ovaries is not significant enough in terms of a difference to mean that we shouldn't have the right to vote, the right to full citizenship, the right to own property, etc." And women successfully argued that.
Next came the successful Civil Rights Movement, where we found people like Sojourner Truth talking about, "Ain't I a woman?" We find men on the marching lines of the Civil Rights Movement saying, "I am a man." Again, people of color appealing to a commonality of anatomy over a difference of anatomy, again, successfully.
We see the same thing with the disability rights movement.
The problem is, of course, that, as we begin to look at all that commonality, we have to begin to question why we maintain certain divisions.
Mind you, I want to maintain some divisions, anatomically, in our culture.
For example, I don't want to give a fish the same rights as a human.
I don't want to say we give up entirely on anatomy.
I don't want to say a five-year-old should be allowed to consent to sex or consent to marry.
So there are some anatomical divisions that make sense to me and that I think we should retain.
But the challenge is trying to figure out which ones they are and why do we retain them, and do they have meaning.
So let's go back to those two beings conceived at the beginning of this talk.
We have two beings, both conceived in the middle of 1979 on the exact same day.
Let's imagine one of them, Mary, is born three months prematurely, so she's born on June 1, 1980.
Henry, by contrast, is born at term, so he's born on March 1, 1980. Simply by virtue of the fact that Mary was born prematurely three months, she comes into all sorts of rights three months earlier than Henry does — the right to consent to sex, the right to vote, the right to drink.
Henry has to wait for all of that, not because he's actually any different in age, biologically, except in terms of when he was born.
We find other kinds of weirdness in terms of what their rights are.
Henry, by virtue of being assumed to be male — although I haven't told you that he's the XY one — by virtue of being assumed to be male is now liable to be drafted, which Mary does not need to worry about.
Mary, meanwhile, cannot in all the states have the same right that Henry has in all the states, namely, the right to marry.
Henry can marry, in every state, a woman, but Mary can only marry today in a few states, a woman.
So we have these anatomical categories that persist, that are in many ways problematic and questionable.
And the question to me becomes: What do we do, as our science gets to be so good in looking at anatomy, that we reach the point where we have to admit that a democracy that's been based on anatomy might start falling apart?
I don't want to give up the science, but at the same time, it feels sometimes like the science is coming out from under us.
So where do we go?
It seems like what happens in our culture is a sort of pragmatic attitude: "We have to draw the line somewhere, so we will draw the line somewhere." But a lot of people get stuck in a very strange position.
So for example, Texas has at one point decided that what it means to marry a man is to mean that you don't have a Y chromosome, and what it means to marry a woman means you have a Y chromosome.
In practice they don't test people for their chromosomes.
But this is also very bizarre, because of the story I told you at the beginning about androgen insensitivity syndrome.
If we look at one of the Founding Fathers of modern democracy, Dr. Martin Luther King, he offers us something of a solution in his "I have a dream" speech.
He says we should judge people "based not on the color of their skin, but on the content of their character," moving beyond anatomy.
And I want to say, "Yeah, that sounds like a really good idea." But in practice, how do you do it?
How do you judge people based on the content of character?
I also want to point out that I'm not sure that is how we should distribute rights in terms of humans, because, I have to admit, that there are some golden retrievers I know that are probably more deserving of social services than some humans I know.
I also want to say there are probably also some yellow Labradors that I know that are more capable of informed, intelligent, mature decisions about sexual relations than some 40-year-olds that I know.
So how do we operationalize the question of content of character?
It turns out to be really difficult.
And part of me also wonders, what if content of character turns out to be something that's scannable in the future — able to be seen with an fMRI?
Do we really want to go there?
I'm not sure where we go.
What I do know is that it seems to be really important to think about the idea of the United States being in the lead of thinking about this issue of democracy.
We've done a really good job struggling with democracy, and I think we would do a good job in the future.
We don't have a situation that Iran has, for example, where a man who's sexually attracted to other men is liable to be murdered, unless he's willing to submit to a sex change, in which case he's allowed to live.
We don't have that kind of situation.
I'm glad to say we don't have the kind of situation with — a surgeon I talked to a few years ago who had brought over a set of conjoined twins in order to separate them, partly to make a name for himself.
But when I was on the phone with him, asking why he'll do this surgery — this was a very high-risk surgery — his answer was that, in this other nation, these children were going to be treated very badly, and so he had to do this.
My response to him was, "Well, have you considered political asylum instead of a separation surgery?" The United States has offered tremendous possibility for allowing people to be the way they are, without having them have to be changed for the sake of the state.
So I think we have to be in the lead.
Well, just to close, I want to suggest to you that I've been talking a lot about the Fathers.
And I want to think about the possibilities of what democracy might look like, or might have looked like, if we had more involved the mothers.
And I want to say something a little bit radical for a feminist, and that is that I think that there may be different kinds of insights that can come from different kinds of anatomies, particularly when we have people thinking in groups.
For years, because I've been interested in intersex, I've also been interested in sex-difference research.
And one of the things that I've been interested in is looking at the differences between males and females in terms of the way they think and operate in the world.
And what we know from cross-cultural studies is that females, on average — not everyone, but on average — are more inclined to be very attentive to complex social relations and to taking care of people who are, basically, vulnerable within the group.
And so if we think about that, we have an interesting situation in hands.
Years ago, when I was in graduate school, one of my graduate advisors who knew I was interested in feminism — I considered myself a feminist, as I still do, asked a really strange question.
He said, "Tell me what's feminine about feminism." And I thought, "Well, that's the dumbest question I've ever heard.
Feminism is all about undoing stereotypes about gender, so there's nothing feminine about feminism. "But the more I thought about his question, the more I thought there might be something feminine about feminism.
That is to say, there might be something, on average, different about female brains from male brains that makes us more attentive to deeply complex social relationships, and more attentive to taking care of the vulnerable.
So whereas the Fathers were extremely attentive to figuring out how to protect individuals from the state, it's possible that if we injected more mothers into this concept, what we would have is more of a concept of not just how to protect, but how to care for each other.
And maybe that's where we need to go in the future, when we take democracy beyond anatomy, is to think less about the individual body in terms of the identity, and think more about those relationships.
So that as we the people try to create a more perfect union, we're thinking about what we do for each other.
Thank you.

As an artist, connection is very important to me.
Through my work I'm trying to articulate that humans are not separate from nature and that everything is interconnected.
I first went to Antarctica almost 10 years ago, where I saw my first icebergs. I was in awe.
My heart beat fast, my head was dizzy, trying to comprehend what it was that stood in front of me.
The icebergs around me were almost 200 feet out of the water, and I could only help but wonder that this was one snowflake on top of another snowflake, year after year.
Icebergs are born when they calve off of glaciers or break off of ice shelves.
Each iceberg has its own individual personality.
They have a distinct way of interacting with their environment and their experiences.
Some refuse to give up and hold on to the bitter end, while others can't take it anymore and crumble in a fit of dramatic passion.
It's easy to think, when you look at an iceberg, that they're isolated, that they're separate and alone, much like we as humans sometimes view ourselves.
But the reality is far from it.
As an iceberg melts, I am breathing in its ancient atmosphere.
As the iceberg melts, it is releasing mineral-rich fresh water that nourishes many forms of life.
I approach photographing these icebergs as if I'm making portraits of my ancestors, knowing that in these individual moments they exist in that way and will never exist that way again.
It is not a death when they melt; it is not an end, but a continuation of their path through the cycle of life.
Some of the ice in the icebergs that I photograph is very young — a couple thousand years old.
And some of the ice is over 100,000 years old.
The last pictures I'd like to show you are of an iceberg that I photographed in Qeqetarsuaq, Greenland.
It's a very rare occasion that you get to actually witness an iceberg rolling.
So here it is.
You can see on the left side a small boat.
That's about a 15-foot boat.
And I'd like you to pay attention to the shape of the iceberg and where it is at the waterline.
You can see here, it begins to roll, and the boat has moved to the other side, and the man is standing there.
This is an average-size Greenlandic iceberg.
It's about 120 feet above the water, or 40 meters.
And this video is real time.
(Music)
And just like that, the iceberg shows you a different side of its personality.
Thank you.
You know, what I do is write for children, and I'm probably America's most widely read children's author, in fact.
And I always tell people that I don't want to show up looking like a scientist.
You can have me as a farmer, or in leathers, and no one has ever chose farmer.
I'm here today to talk to you about circles and epiphanies.
And you know, an epiphany is usually something you find that you dropped someplace.
You've just got to go around the block to see it as an epiphany.
That's a painting of a circle.
A friend of mine did that — Richard Bollingbroke.
It's the kind of complicated circle that I'm going to tell you about.
My circle began back in the '60s in high school in Stow, Ohio where I was the class queer.
I was the guy beaten up bloody every week in the boys' room, until one teacher saved my life.
She saved my life by letting me go to the bathroom in the teachers' lounge.
She did it for three years. And I had to get out of town.
I had a thumb, I had 85 dollars, and I ended up in San Francisco, California — met a lover — and back in the '80s, found it necessary to begin work on AIDS organizations.
About three or four years ago, I got a phone call in the middle of the night from that teacher, Mrs. Posten, who said, "I need to see you.
I'm disappointed that we never got to know each other as adults.
Could you please come to Ohio, and please bring that man that I know you have found by now.
And I should mention that I have pancreatic cancer, and I'd like you to please be quick about this. "
Well, the next day we were in Cleveland.
We took a look at her, we laughed, we cried, and we knew that she needed to be in a hospice.
We found her one, we got her there, and we took care of her and watched over her family, because it was necessary. It's something we knew how to do.
And just as the woman who wanted to know me as an adult got to know me, she turned into a box of ashes and was placed in my hands.
And what had happened was the circle had closed, it had become a circle — and that epiphany I talked about presented itself.
The epiphany is that death is a part of life.
She saved my life; I and my partner saved hers.
And you know, that part of life needs everything that the rest of life does.
It needs truth and beauty, and I'm so happy it's been mentioned so much here today.
It also needs — it needs dignity, love and pleasure, and it's our job to hand those things out.
Thank you.
(Applause)
In the 1980s, in communist Eastern Germany, if you owned a typewriter, you had to register it with the government.
You had to register a sample sheet of text out of the typewriter.
And this was done so the government could track where the text was coming from.
If they found a paper which had the wrong kind of thought, they could track down who created that thought.
And we in the West couldn't understand how anybody would do this, how much this would restrict freedom of speech.
We would never do that in our own countries.
But today, in 2011, if you go and buy a color laser printer from any major laser printer manufacturer and print a page, that page will end up having slight yellow dots printed on every single page, in a pattern which makes the page unique to you and to your printer.
This is happening to us today.
And nobody seems to be making a fuss about it.
And this is an example of the ways our own governments are using technology against us, the citizens.
And this is one of the main three sources of online problems today.
If we look at what's really happening in the online world, we can group the attacks based on the attackers.
We have three main groups. We have online criminals. Like here, we have Mr. Dmitry Golubov, from the city of Kiev in Ukraine.
And the motives of online criminals are very easy to understand.
These guys make money.
They use online attacks to make lots of money — and lots and lots of it.
We actually have several cases of millionaires online, multimillionaires, who made money with their attacks.
Here's Vladimir Tsastsin, from Tartu in Estonia.
This is Matthew Anderson, Tariq Al-Daour and so on and so on.
These guys make their fortunes online, but they make it through the illegal means of using things like banking Trojans to steal money from our bank accounts while we do online banking, or with keyloggers to collect our credit card information while we are doing online shopping from an infected computer.
The US Secret Service, two months ago, froze the Swiss bank account of Mr. Sam Jain right here, and that bank account had 14.9 million US dollars in it when it was frozen.
Mr. Jain himself is on the loose; nobody knows where he is.
And I claim it's already today that it's more likely for any of us to become the victim of a crime online than here in the real world.
And it's very obvious that this is only going to get worse.
In the future, the majority of crime will be happening online.
The second major group of attackers that we are watching today are not motivated by money.
They're motivated by something else — motivated by protests, motivated by an opinion, motivated by the laughs.
Groups like Anonymous have risen up over the last 12 months and have become a major player in the field of online attacks.
So those are the three main attackers: criminals who do it for the money, hacktivists like Anonymous doing it for the protest, but then the last group are nation states — governments doing the attacks.
And then we look at cases like what happened in DigiNotar.
This is a prime example of what happens when governments attack against their own citizens.
DigiNotar is a certificate authority from the Netherlands — or actually, it was.
It was running into bankruptcy last fall, because they were hacked into.
Somebody broke in and they hacked it thoroughly.
And I asked last week, in a meeting with Dutch government representatives, I asked one of the leaders of the team whether he found plausible that people died because of the DigiNotar hack.
And his answer was: yes.
So how do people die as the result of a hack like this?
Well, DigiNotar is a CA. They sell certificates. What do you do with certificates?
Well, you need a certificate if you have a website that has https, SSL encrypted services, services like Gmail.
Now we all, or a big part of us, use Gmail or one of their competitors, but these services are especially popular in totalitarian states like Iran, where dissidents use foreign services like Gmail because they know they are more trustworthy than the local services and they are encrypted over SSL connections, so the local government can't snoop on their discussions.
Except they can, if they hack into a foreign CA and issue rogue certificates.
And this is exactly what happened with the case of DigiNotar.
What about Arab Spring and things that have been happening, for example, in Egypt?
Well, in Egypt, the rioters looted the headquarters of the Egyptian secret police in April 2011, and when they were looting the building, they found lots of papers.
Among those papers was this binder entitled, "FinFisher." And within that binder were notes from a company based in Germany, which had sold to the Egyptian government a set of tools for intercepting, at a very large scale, all the communication of the citizens of the country.
They had sold this tool for 280,000 euros to the Egyptian government.
The company headquarters are right here.
So Western governments are providing totalitarian governments with tools to do this against their own citizens.
But Western governments are doing it to themselves as well.
For example, in Germany, just a couple of weeks ago, the so-called "State Trojan" was found, which was a Trojan used by German government officials to investigate their own citizens.
If you are a suspect in a criminal case, well, it's pretty obvious, your phone will be tapped.
But today, it goes beyond that.
They will tap your Internet connection.
They will even use tools like State Trojan to infect your computer with a Trojan, which enables them to watch all your communication, to listen to your online discussions, to collect your passwords.
Now, when we think deeper about things like these, the obvious response from people should be, "OK, well, that sounds bad, but that doesn't really affect me, because I'm a legal citizen.
Why should I worry?
Because I have nothing to hide. "And this is an argument which doesn't make sense. Privacy is implied. Privacy is not up for discussion.
This is not a question between privacy against security.
It's a question of freedom against control.
And while we might trust our governments right now, right here in 2011, any rights we give away will be given away for good.
And do we trust, do we blindly trust, any future government, a government we might have 50 years from now?
And these are the questions that we have to worry about for the next 50 years.
Do you know how many choices you make in a typical day?
Do you know how many choices you make in typical week?
I recently did a survey with over 2,000 Americans, and the average number of choices that the typical American reports making is about 70 in a typical day. There was also recently a study done with CEOs in which they followed CEOs around for a whole week.
And these scientists simply documented all the various tasks that these CEOs engaged in and how much time they spent engaging in making decisions related to these tasks.
And they found that the average CEO engaged in about 139 tasks in a week.
Each task was made up of many, many, many sub-choices of course.
50 percent of their decisions were made in nine minutes or less.
Only about 12 percent of the decisions did they make an hour or more of their time.
Think about your own choices.
Do you know how many choices make it into your nine minute category versus your one hour category?
How well do you think you're doing at managing those choices?
Today I want to talk about one of the biggest modern day choosing problems that we have, which is the choice overload problem.
I want to talk about the problem and some potential solutions.
Now as I talk about this problem, I'm going to have some questions for you and I'm going to want to know your answers.
So when I ask you a question, since I'm blind, only raise your hand if you want to burn off some calories. (Laughter) Otherwise, when I ask you a question, and if your answer is yes, I'd like you to clap your hands.
So for my first question for you today: Are you guys ready to hear about the choice overload problem? (Applause) Thank you.
So when I was a graduate student at Stanford University, I used to go to this very, very upscale grocery store; at least at that time it was truly upscale.
It was a store called Draeger's.
Now this store, it was almost like going to an amusement park.
They had 250 different kinds of mustards and vinegars and over 500 different kinds of fruits and vegetables and more than two dozen different kinds of bottled water — and this was during a time when we actually used to drink tap water.
I used to love going to this store, but on one occasion I asked myself, well how come you never buy anything?
Here's their olive oil aisle.
They had over 75 different kinds of olive oil, including those that were in a locked case that came from thousand-year-old olive trees.
So I one day decided to pay a visit to the manager, and I asked the manager, "Is this model of offering people all this choice really working?" And he pointed to the busloads of tourists that would show up everyday, with cameras ready usually.
We decided to do a little experiment, and we picked jam for our experiment.
Here's their jam aisle.
They had 348 different kinds of jam.
We set up a little tasting booth right near the entrance of the store.
We there put out six different flavors of jam or 24 different flavors of jam, and we looked at two things: First, in which case were people more likely to stop, sample some jam?
More people stopped when there were 24, about 60 percent, than when there were six, about 40 percent.
The next thing we looked at is in which case were people more likely to buy a jar of jam.
Now we see the opposite effect.
Of the people who stopped when there were 24, only three percent of them actually bought a jar of jam.
Of the people who stopped when there were six, well now we saw that 30 percent of them actually bought a jar of jam.
Now if you do the math, people were at least six times more likely to buy a jar of jam if they encountered six than if they encountered 24.
Now choosing not to buy a jar of jam is probably good for us — at least it's good for our waistlines — but it turns out that this choice overload problem affects us even in very consequential decisions.
We choose not to choose, even when it goes against our best self-interests.
So now for the topic of today: financial savings.
Now I'm going to describe to you a study I did with Gur Huberman, Emir Kamenica, Wei Jang where we looked at the retirement savings decisions of nearly a million Americans from about 650 plans all in the U.S. And what we looked at was whether the number of fund offerings available in a retirement savings plan, the 401 (k) plan, does that affect people's likelihood to save more for tomorrow.
And what we found was that indeed there was a correlation.
So in these plans, we had about 657 plans that ranged from offering people anywhere from two to 59 different fund offerings.
And what we found was that, the more funds offered, indeed, there was less participation rate.
So if you look at the extremes, those plans that offered you two funds, participation rates were around in the mid-70s — still not as high as we want it to be.
In those plans that offered nearly 60 funds, participation rates have now dropped to about the 60th percentile.
Now it turns out that even if you do choose to participate when there are more choices present, even then, it has negative consequences.
So for those people who did choose to participate, the more choices available, the more likely people were to completely avoid stocks or equity funds.
The more choices available, the more likely they were to put all their money in pure money market accounts.
Now neither of these extreme decisions are the kinds of decisions that any of us would recommend for people when you're considering their future financial well-being.
Well, over the past decade, we have observed three main negative consequences to offering people more and more choices.
They're more likely to delay choosing — procrastinate even when it goes against their best self-interest.
They're more likely to make worse choices — worse financial choices, medical choices.
They're more likely to choose things that make them less satisfied, even when they do objectively better.
The main reason for this is because, we might enjoy gazing at those giant walls of mayonnaises, mustards, vinegars, jams, but we can't actually do the math of comparing and contrasting and actually picking from that stunning display.
So what I want to propose to you today are four simple techniques — techniques that we have tested in one way or another in different research venues — that you can easily apply in your businesses.
The first: Cut. You've heard it said before, but it's never been more true than today, that less is more.
People are always upset when I say, "Cut." They're always worried they're going to lose shelf space.
But in fact, what we're seeing more and more is that if you are willing to cut, get rid of those extraneous redundant options, well there's an increase in sales, there's a lowering of costs, there is an improvement of the choosing experience.
When Proctor & amp; Gamble went from 26 different kinds of Head & amp; Shoulders to 15, they saw an increase in sales by 10 percent.
When the Golden Cat Corporation got rid of their 10 worst-selling cat litter products, they saw an increase in profits by 87 percent — a function of both increase in sales and lowering of costs.
You know, the average grocery store today offers you 45,000 products.
The typical Walmart today offers you 100,000 products.
But the ninth largest retailer, the ninth biggest retailer in the world today is Aldi, and it offers you only 1,400 products — one kind of canned tomato sauce.
Now in the financial savings world, I think one of the best examples that has recently come out on how to best manage the choice offerings has actually been something that David Laibson was heavily involved in designing, which was the program that they have at Harvard.
Every single Harvard employee is now automatically enrolled in a lifecycle fund.
For those people who actually want to choose, they're given 20 funds, not 300 or more funds.
You know, often, people say, "I don't know how to cut.
They're all important choices. "And the first thing I do is I ask the employees," Tell me how these choices are different from one another.
And if your employees can't tell them apart, neither can your consumers. "
Now before we started our session this afternoon, I had a chat with Gary.
And Gary said that he would be willing to offer people in this audience an all-expenses-paid free vacation to the most beautiful road in the world.
Here's a description of the road.
And I'd like you to read it.
And now I'll give you a few seconds to read it and then I want you to clap your hands if you're ready to take Gary up on his offer. (Light clapping) Okay.
Anybody who's ready to take him up on his offer. Is that all? All right, let me show you some more about this. (Laughter) You guys knew there was a trick, didn't you. (Honk) Now who's ready to go on this trip. (Applause) (Laughter) I think I might have actually heard more hands.
All right. Now in fact, you had objectively more information the first time around than the second time around, but I would venture to guess that you felt that it was more real the second time around.
Because the pictures made it feel more real to you.
Which brings me to the second technique for handling the choice overload problem, which is concretization.
That in order for people to understand the differences between the choices, they have to be able to understand the consequences associated with each choice, and that the consequences need to be felt in a vivid sort of way, in a very concrete way.
Why do people spend an average of 15 to 30 percent more when they use an ATM card or a credit card as opposed to cash?
Because it doesn't feel like real money.
And it turns out that making it feel more concrete can actually be a very positive tool to use in getting people to save more.
So a study that I did with Shlomo Benartzi and Alessandro Previtero, we did a study with people at ING — employees that are all working at ING — and now these people were all in a session where they're doing enrollment for their 401 (k) plan.
And during that session, we kept the session exactly the way it used to be, but we added one little thing.
The one little thing we added was we asked people to just think about all the positive things that would happen in your life if you saved more.
By doing that simple thing, there was an increase in enrollment by 20 percent and there was an increase in the amount of people willing to save or the amount that they were willing to put down into their savings account by four percent.
The third technique: Categorization.
We can handle more categories than we can handle choices.
So for example, here's a study we did in a magazine aisle.
It turns out that in Wegmans grocery stores up and down the northeast corridor, the magazine aisles range anywhere from 331 different kinds of magazines all the way up to 664.
But you know what?
If I show you 600 magazines and I divide them up into 10 categories, versus I show you 400 magazines and divide them up into 20 categories, you believe that I have given you more choice and a better choosing experience if I gave you the 400 than if I gave you the 600.
Because the categories tell me how to tell them apart.
Here are two different jewelry displays.
One is called "Jazz" and the other one is called "Swing." If you think the display on the left is Swing and the display on the right is Jazz, clap your hands. (Light Clapping) Okay, there's some.
If you think the one on the left is Jazz and the one on the right is Swing, clap your hands.
Okay, a bit more.
Now it turns out you're right.
The one on the left is Jazz and the one on the right is Swing, but you know what?
This is a highly useless categorization scheme. (Laughter) The categories need to say something to the chooser, not the choice-maker.
And you often see that problem when it comes down to those long lists of all these funds.
Who are they actually supposed to be informing?
My fourth technique: Condition for complexity.
It turns out we can actually handle a lot more information than we think we can, we've just got to take it a little easier.
We have to gradually increase the complexity.
I'm going to show you one example of what I'm talking about.
Let's take a very, very complicated decision: buying a car.
Here's a German car manufacturer that gives you the opportunity to completely custom make your car.
You've got to make 60 different decisions, completely make up your car.
Now these decisions vary in the number of choices that they offer per decision.
Car colors, exterior car colors — I've got 56 choices.
Engines, gearshift — four choices.
So now what I'm going to do is I'm going to vary the order in which these decisions appear.
So half of the customers are going to go from high choice, 56 car colors, to low choice, four gearshifts.
The other half of the customers are going to go from low choice, four gearshifts, to 56 car colors, high choice.
What am I going to look at?
How engaged you are.
If you keep hitting the default button per decision, that means you're getting overwhelmed, that means I'm losing you.
What you find is the people who go from high choice to low choice, they're hitting that default button over and over and over again. We're losing them. They go from low choice to high choice, they're hanging in there.
It's the same information.
It's the same number of choices.
The only thing that I have done is I have varied the order in which that information is presented.
If I start you off easy, I learn how to choose.
Even though choosing gearshift doesn't tell me anything about my preferences for interior decor, it still prepares me for how to choose.
It also gets me excited about this big product that I'm putting together, so I'm more willing to be motivated to be engaged.
So let me recap. I have talked about four techniques for mitigating the problem of choice overload — cut — get rid of the extraneous alternatives; concretize — make it real; categorize — we can handle more categories, less choices; condition for complexity.
All of these techniques that I'm describing to you today are designed to help you manage your choices — better for you, you can use them on yourself, better for the people that you are serving.
Because I believe that the key to getting the most from choice is to be choosy about choosing.
And the more we're able to be choosy about choosing the better we will be able to practice the art of choosing.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
I think we have to do something about a piece of the culture of medicine that has to change.
And I think it starts with one physician, and that's me.
And maybe I've been around long enough that I can afford to give away some of my false prestige to be able to do that.
Before I actually begin the meat of my talk, let's begin with a bit of baseball.
Hey, why not?
We're near the end, we're getting close to the World Series.
We all love baseball, don't we? (Laughter) Baseball is filled with some amazing statistics.
And there's hundreds of them. "Moneyball" is about to come out, and it's all about statistics and using statistics to build a great baseball team.
I'm going to focus on one stat that I hope a lot of you have heard of.
It's called batting average.
So we talk about a 300, a batter who bats 300.
That means that ballplayer batted safely, hit safely three times out of 10 at bats.
That means hit the ball into the outfield, it dropped, it didn't get caught, and whoever tried to throw it to first base didn't get there in time and the runner was safe.
Three times out of 10. Do you know what they call a 300 hitter in Major League Baseball?
Good, really good, maybe an all-star.
Do you know what they call a 400 baseball hitter?
That's somebody who hit, by the way, four times safely out of every 10.
Legendary — as in Ted Williams legendary — the last Major League Baseball player to hit over 400 during a regular season.
Now let's take this back into my world of medicine where I'm a lot more comfortable, or perhaps a bit less comfortable after what I'm going to talk to you about.
Suppose you have appendicitis and you're referred to a surgeon who's batting 400 on appendectomies. (Laughter) Somehow this isn't working out, is it?
Now suppose you live in a certain part of a certain remote place and you have a loved one who has blockages in two coronary arteries and your family doctor refers that loved one to a cardiologist who's batting 200 on angioplasties.
But, but, you know what?
She's doing a lot better this year.
She's on the comeback trail.
And she's hitting a 257.
Somehow this isn't working.
But I'm going to ask you a question.
What do you think a batting average for a cardiac surgeon or a nurse practitioner or an orthopedic surgeon, an OBGYN, a paramedic is supposed to be?
1,000, very good.
Now truth of the matter is, nobody knows in all of medicine what a good surgeon or physician or paramedic is supposed to bat.
What we do though is we send each one of them, including myself, out into the world with the admonition, be perfect.
Never ever, ever make a mistake, but you worry about the details, about how that's going to happen.
And that was the message that I absorbed when I was in med school.
I was an obsessive compulsive student.
In high school, a classmate once said that Brian Goldman would study for a blood test. (Laughter) And so I did.
And I studied in my little garret at the nurses' residence at Toronto General Hospital, not far from here.
And I memorized everything.
I memorized in my anatomy class the origins and exertions of every muscle, every branch of every artery that came off the aorta, differential diagnoses obscure and common.
I even knew the differential diagnosis in how to classify renal tubular acidosis.
And all the while, I was amassing more and more knowledge.
And I did well, I graduated with honors, cum laude.
And I came out of medical school with the impression that if I memorized everything and knew everything, or as much as possible, as close to everything as possible, that it would immunize me against making mistakes.
And it worked for a while, until I met Mrs. Drucker.
I was a resident at a teaching hospital here in Toronto when Mrs. Drucker was brought to the emergency department of the hospital where I was working.
At the time I was assigned to the cardiology service on a cardiology rotation.
And it was my job, when the emergency staff called for a cardiology consult, to see that patient in emerg. and to report back to my attending.
And I saw Mrs. Drucker, and she was breathless.
And when I listened to her, she was making a wheezy sound.
And when I listened to her chest with a stethoscope, I could hear crackly sounds on both sides that told me that she was in congestive heart failure.
This is a condition in which the heart fails, and instead of being able to pump all the blood forward, some of the blood backs up into the lung, the lungs fill up with blood, and that's why you have shortness of breath.
And that wasn't a difficult diagnosis to make.
I made it and I set to work treating her.
I gave her aspirin.
I gave her medications to relieve the strain on her heart.
I gave her medications that we call diuretics, water pills, to get her to pee out the access fluid.
And over the course of the next hour and a half or two, she started to feel better.
And I felt really good.
And that's when I made my first mistake; I sent her home.
Actually, I made two more mistakes.
I sent her home without speaking to my attending.
I didn't pick up the phone and do what I was supposed to do, which was call my attending and run the story by him so he would have a chance to see her for himself.
And he knew her, he would have been able to furnish additional information about her.
Maybe I did it for a good reason.
Maybe I didn't want to be a high-maintenance resident.
Maybe I wanted to be so successful and so able to take responsibility that I would do so and I would be able to take care of my attending's patients without even having to contact him.
The second mistake that I made was worse.
In sending her home, I disregarded a little voice deep down inside that was trying to tell me, "Goldman, not a good idea.
Don't do this. "In fact, so lacking in confidence was I that I actually asked the nurse who was looking after Mrs. Drucker," Do you think it's okay if she goes home? "And the nurse thought about it and said very matter-of-factly," Yeah, I think she'll do okay. "I can remember that like it was yesterday.
So I signed the discharge papers, and an ambulance came, paramedics came to take her home.
And I went back to my work on the wards.
All the rest of that day, that afternoon, I had this kind of gnawing feeling inside my stomach.
But I carried on with my work.
And at the end of the day, I packed up to leave the hospital and walked to the parking lot to take my car and drive home when I did something that I don't usually do.
I walked through the emergency department on my way home.
And it was there that another nurse, not the nurse who was looking after Mrs. Drucker before, but another nurse, said three words to me that are the three words that most emergency physicians I know dread.
Others in medicine dread them as well, but there's something particular about emergency medicine because we see patients so fleetingly.
The three words are: Do you remember? "Do you remember that patient you sent home?" the other nurse asked matter-of-factly. "Well she's back," in just that tone of voice.
Well she was back all right. She was back and near death.
About an hour after she had arrived home, after I'd sent her home, she collapsed and her family called 911 and the paramedics brought her back to the emergency department where she had a blood pressure of 50, which is in severe shock.
And she was barely breathing and she was blue.
And the emerg. staff pulled out all the stops.
They gave her medications to raise her blood pressure.
They put her on a ventilator.
And I was shocked and shaken to the core.
And I went through this roller coaster, because after they stabilized her, she went to the intensive care unit, and I hoped against hope that she would recover.
And over the next two or three days, it was clear that she was never going to wake up.
She had irreversible brain damage.
And the family gathered.
And over the course of the next eight or nine days, they resigned themselves to what was happening.
And at about the nine day mark, they let her go — Mrs. Drucker, a wife, a mother and a grandmother.
They say you never forget the names of those who die.
And that was my first time to be acquainted with that.
Over the next few weeks, I beat myself up and I experienced for the first time the unhealthy shame that exists in our culture of medicine — where I felt alone, isolated, not feeling the healthy kind of shame that you feel, because you can't talk about it with your colleagues.
You know that healthy kind, when you betray a secret that a best friend made you promise never to reveal and then you get busted and then your best friend confronts you and you have terrible discussions, but at the end of it all that sick feeling guides you and you say, I'll never make that mistake again.
And you make amends and you never make that mistake again.
That's the kind of shame that is a teacher.
The unhealthy shame I'm talking about is the one that makes you so sick inside.
It's the one that says, not that what you did was bad, but that you are bad.
And it was what I was feeling.
And it wasn't because of my attending; he was a doll.
He talked to the family, and I'm quite sure that he smoothed things over and made sure that I didn't get sued.
And I kept asking myself these questions.
Why didn't I ask my attending?
Why did I send her home?
And then at my worst moments: Why did I make such a stupid mistake?
Why did I go into medicine?
Slowly but surely, it lifted.
I began to feel a bit better.
And on a cloudy day, there was a crack in the clouds and the sun started to come out and I wondered, maybe I could feel better again.
And I made myself a bargain that if only I redouble my efforts to be perfect and never make another mistake again, please make the voices stop. And they did. And I went back to work.
And then it happened again.
Two years later I was an attending in the emergency department at a community hospital just north of Toronto, and I saw a 25 year-old man with a sore throat.
It was busy, I was in a bit of a hurry.
He kept pointing here.
I looked at his throat, it was a little bit pink.
And I gave him a prescription for penicillin and sent him on his way.
And even as he was walking out the door, he was still sort of pointing to his throat.
And two days later I came to do my next emergency shift, and that's when my chief asked to speak to me quietly in her office.
And she said the three words: Do you remember? "Do you remember that patient you saw with the sore throat?" Well it turns out, he didn't have a strep throat.
He had a potentially life-threatening condition called epiglottitis.
You can Google it, but it's an infection, not of the throat, but of the upper airway, and it can actually cause the airway to close.
And fortunately he didn't die.
He was placed on intravenous antibiotics and he recovered after a few days.
And I went through the same period of shame and recriminations and felt cleansed and went back to work, until it happened again and again and again.
Twice in one emergency shift, I missed appendicitis.
Now that takes some doing, especially when you work in a hospital that at the time saw but 14 people a night.
Now in both cases, I didn't send them home and I don't think there was any gap in their care.
One I thought had a kidney stone.
I ordered a kidney X-ray.
When it turned out to be normal, my colleague who was doing a reassessment of the patient noticed some tenderness in the right lower quadrant and called the surgeons.
The other one had a lot of diarrhea.
I ordered some fluids to rehydrate him and asked my colleague to reassess him.
And he did and when he noticed some tenderness in the right lower quadrant, called the surgeons.
In both cases, they had their operations and they did okay.
But each time, they were gnawing at me, eating at me.
And I'd like to be able to say to you that my worst mistakes only happened in the first five years of practice as many of my colleagues say, which is total B.S. (Laughter) Some of my doozies have been in the last five years.
Alone, ashamed and unsupported.
Here's the problem: If I can't come clean and talk about my mistakes, if I can't find the still-small voice that tells me what really happened, how can I share it with my colleagues?
How can I teach them about what I did so that they don't do the same thing?
If I were to walk into a room — like right now, I have no idea what you think of me.
When was the last time you heard somebody talk about failure after failure after failure?
Oh yeah, you go to a cocktail party and you might hear about some other doctor, but you're not going to hear somebody talking about their own mistakes.
If I were to walk into a room filled with my colleages and ask for their support right now and start to tell what I've just told you right now, I probably wouldn't get through two of those stories before they would start to get really uncomfortable, somebody would crack a joke, they'd change the subject and we would move on.
And in fact, if I knew and my colleagues knew that one of my orthopedic colleagues took off the wrong leg in my hospital, believe me, I'd have trouble making eye contact with that person.
That's the system that we have.
It's a complete denial of mistakes.
It's a system in which there are two kinds of physicians — those who make mistakes and those who don't, those who can't handle sleep deprivation and those who can, those who have lousy outcomes and those who have great outcomes.
And it's almost like an ideological reaction, like the antibodies begin to attack that person.
And we have this idea that if we drive the people who make mistakes out of medicine, what will we be left with, but a safe system.
But there are two problems with that.
In my 20 years or so of medical broadcasting and journalism, I've made a personal study of medical malpractice and medical errors to learn everything I can, from one of the first articles I wrote for the Toronto Star to my show "White Coat, Black Art." And what I've learned is that errors are absolutely ubiquitous.
We work in a system where errors happen every day, where one in 10 medications are either the wrong medication given in hospital or at the wrong dosage, where hospital-acquired infections are getting more and more numerous, causing havoc and death.
In this country, as many as 24,000 Canadians die of preventable medical errors.
In the United States, the Institute of Medicine pegged it at 100,000.
In both cases, these are gross underestimates, because we really aren't ferreting out the problem as we should.
And here's the thing.
In a hospital system where medical knowledge is doubling every two or three years, we can't keep up with it. Sleep deprivation is absolutely pervasive. We can't get rid of it.
We have our cognitive biases, so that I can take a perfect history on a patient with chest pain.
Now take the same patient with chest pain, make them moist and garrulous and put a little bit of alcohol on their breath, and suddenly my history is laced with contempt.
I don't take the same history.
I'm not a robot; I don't do things the same way each time.
And my patients aren't cars; they don't tell me their symptoms in the same way each time. Given all of that, mistakes are inevitable.
So if you take the system, as I was taught, and weed out all the error-prone health professionals, well there won't be anybody left.
And you know that business about people not wanting to talk about their worst cases?
On my show, on "White Coat, Black Art," I made it a habit of saying, "Here's my worst mistake," I would say to everybody from paramedics to the chief of cardiac surgery, "Here's my worst mistake," blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, "What about yours?" and I would point the microphone towards them.
And their pupils would dilate, they would recoil, then they would look down and swallow hard and start to tell me their stories.
They want to tell their stories.
They want to share their stories.
They want to be able to say, "Look, don't make the same mistake I did." What they need is an environment to be able to do that.
What they need is a redefined medical culture.
And it starts with one physician at a time.
The redefined physician is human, knows she's human, accepts it, isn't proud of making mistakes, but strives to learn one thing from what happened that she can teach to somebody else.
She shares her experience with others.
She's supportive when other people talk about their mistakes.
And she points out other people's mistakes, not in a gotcha way, but in a loving, supportive way so that everybody can benefit.
And she works in a culture of medicine that acknowledges that human beings run the system, and when human beings run the system, they will make mistakes from time to time.
So the system is evolving to create backups that make it easier to detect those mistakes that humans inevitably make and also fosters in a loving, supportive way places where everybody who is observing in the health care system can actually point out things that could be potential mistakes and is rewarded for doing so, and especially people like me, when we do make mistakes, we're rewarded for coming clean.
My name is Brian Goldman.
I am a redefined physician. I'm human. I make mistakes. I'm sorry about that, but I strive to learn one thing that I can pass on to other people.
I still don't know what you think of me, but I can live with that.
And let me close with three words of my own: I do remember. (Applause)
Because I usually take the role of trying to explain to people how wonderful the new technologies that are coming along are going to be, and I thought that, since I was among friends here, I would tell you what I really think and try to look back and try to understand what is really going on here with these amazing jumps in technology that seem so fast that we can barely keep on top of it.
So I'm going to start out by showing just one very boring technology slide.
And then, so if you can just turn on the slide that's on.
This is just a random slide that I picked out of my file.
What I want to show you is not so much the details of the slide, but the general form of it.
This happens to be a slide of some analysis that we were doing about the power of RISC microprocessors versus the power of local area networks.
And the interesting thing about it is that this slide, like so many technology slides that we're used to, is a sort of a straight line on a semi-log curve.
In other words, every step here represents an order of magnitude in performance scale.
And this is a new thing that we talk about technology on semi-log curves.
Something really weird is going on here.
And that's basically what I'm going to be talking about.
So, if you could bring up the lights.
If you could bring up the lights higher, because I'm just going to use a piece of paper here.
Now why do we draw technology curves in semi-log curves?
Well the answer is, if I drew it on a normal curve where, let's say, this is years, this is time of some sort, and this is whatever measure of the technology that I'm trying to graph, the graphs look sort of silly.
They sort of go like this.
And they don't tell us much.
Now if I graph, for instance, some other technology, say transportation technology, on a semi-log curve, it would look very stupid, it would look like a flat line.
But when something like this happens, things are qualitatively changing.
So if transportation technology was moving along as fast as microprocessor technology, then the day after tomorrow, I would be able to get in a taxi cab and be in Tokyo in 30 seconds.
It's not moving like that.
And there's nothing precedented in the history of technology development of this kind of self-feeding growth where you go by orders of magnitude every few years.
Now the question that I'd like to ask is, if you look at these exponential curves, they don't go on forever.
Things just can't possibly keep changing as fast as they are. One of two things is going to happen.
Either it's going to turn into a sort of classical S-curve like this, until something totally different comes along, or maybe it's going to do this.
That's about all it can do.
Now I'm an optimist, so I sort of think it's probably going to do something like that.
If so, that means that what we're in the middle of right now is a transition.
We're sort of on this line in a transition from the way the world used to be to some new way that the world is.
And so what I'm trying to ask, what I've been asking myself, is what's this new way that the world is?
What's that new state that the world is heading toward?
Because the transition seems very, very confusing when we're right in the middle of it.
Now when I was a kid growing up, the future was kind of the year 2000, and people used to talk about what would happen in the year 2000.
Now here's a conference in which people talk about the future, and you notice that the future is still at about the year 2000.
It's about as far as we go out.
So in other words, the future has kind of been shrinking one year per year for my whole lifetime.
Now I think that the reason is because we all feel that something's happening there. That transition is happening. We can all sense it.
And we know that it just doesn't make too much sense to think out 30, 50 years because everything's going to be so different that a simple extrapolation of what we're doing just doesn't make any sense at all.
So what I would like to talk about is what that could be, what that transition could be that we're going through.
Now in order to do that I'm going to have to talk about a bunch of stuff that really has nothing to do with technology and computers.
Because I think the only way to understand this is to really step back and take a long time scale look at things.
So the time scale that I would like to look at this on is the time scale of life on Earth.
So I think this picture makes sense if you look at it a few billion years at a time.
So if you go back about two and a half billion years, the Earth was this big, sterile hunk of rock with a lot of chemicals floating around on it.
And if you look at the way that the chemicals got organized, we begin to get a pretty good idea of how they do it.
And I think that there's theories that are beginning to understand about how it started with RNA, but I'm going to tell a sort of simple story of it, which is that, at that time, there were little drops of oil floating around with all kinds of different recipes of chemicals in them.
And some of those drops of oil had a particular combination of chemicals in them which caused them to incorporate chemicals from the outside and grow the drops of oil.
And those that were like that started to split and divide.
And those were the most primitive forms of cells in a sense, those little drops of oil.
But now those drops of oil weren't really alive, as we say it now, because every one of them was a little random recipe of chemicals.
And every time it divided, they got sort of unequal division of the chemicals within them.
And so every drop was a little bit different.
In fact, the drops that were different in a way that caused them to be better at incorporating chemicals around them, grew more and incorporated more chemicals and divided more.
So those tended to live longer, get expressed more.
Now that's sort of just a very simple chemical form of life, but when things got interesting was when these drops learned a trick about abstraction.
Somehow by ways that we don't quite understand, these little drops learned to write down information.
They learned to record the information that was the recipe of the cell onto a particular kind of chemical called DNA.
So in other words, they worked out, in this mindless sort of evolutionary way, a form of writing that let them write down what they were, so that that way of writing it down could get copied.
The amazing thing is that that way of writing seems to have stayed steady since it evolved two and a half billion years ago.
In fact the recipe for us, our genes, is exactly that same code and that same way of writing.
In fact, every living creature is written in exactly the same set of letters and the same code.
In fact, one of the things that I did just for amusement purposes is we can now write things in this code.
And I've got here a little 100 micrograms of white powder, which I try not to let the security people see at airports. (Laughter) But this has in it — what I did is I took this code — the code has standard letters that we use for symbolizing it — and I wrote my business card onto a piece of DNA and amplified it 10 to the 22 times.
So if anyone would like a hundred million copies of my business card, I have plenty for everyone in the room, and, in fact, everyone in the world, and it's right here. (Laughter) If I had really been a egotist, I would have put it into a virus and released it in the room.
(Laughter)
So what was the next step?
Writing down the DNA was an interesting step.
And that caused these cells — that kept them happy for another billion years.
But then there was another really interesting step where things became completely different, which is these cells started exchanging and communicating information, so that they began to get communities of cells.
I don't know if you know this, but bacteria can actually exchange DNA.
Now that's why, for instance, antibiotic resistance has evolved.
Some bacteria figured out how to stay away from penicillin, and it went around sort of creating its little DNA information with other bacteria, and now we have a lot of bacteria that are resistant to penicillin, because bacteria communicate.
Now what this communication allowed was communities to form that, in some sense, were in the same boat together; they were synergistic.
So they survived or they failed together, which means that if a community was very successful, all the individuals in that community were repeated more and they were favored by evolution.
Now the transition point happened when these communities got so close that, in fact, they got together and decided to write down the whole recipe for the community together on one string of DNA.
And so the next stage that's interesting in life took about another billion years.
And at that stage, we have multi-cellular communities, communities of lots of different types of cells, working together as a single organism.
And in fact, we're such a multi-cellular community.
We have lots of cells that are not out for themselves anymore.
Your skin cell is really useless without a heart cell, muscle cell, a brain cell and so on.
So these communities began to evolve so that the interesting level on which evolution was taking place was no longer a cell, but a community which we call an organism.
Now the next step that happened is within these communities.
These communities of cells, again, began to abstract information.
And they began building very special structures that did nothing but process information within the community.
And those are the neural structures.
So neurons are the information processing apparatus that those communities of cells built up.
And in fact, they began to get specialists in the community and special structures that were responsible for recording, understanding, learning information.
And that was the brains and the nervous system of those communities.
And that gave them an evolutionary advantage.
Because at that point, an individual — learning could happen within the time span of a single organism, instead of over this evolutionary time span.
So an organism could, for instance, learn not to eat a certain kind of fruit because it tasted bad and it got sick last time it ate it.
That could happen within the lifetime of a single organism, whereas before they'd built these special information processing structures, that would have had to be learned evolutionarily over hundreds of thousands of years by the individuals dying off that ate that kind of fruit.
So that nervous system, the fact that they built these special information structures, tremendously sped up the whole process of evolution.
Because evolution could now happen within an individual.
It could happen in learning time scales.
But then what happened was the individuals worked out, of course, tricks of communicating.
And for example, the most sophisticated version that we're aware of is human language.
It's really a pretty amazing invention if you think about it.
Here I have a very complicated, messy, confused idea in my head.
I'm sitting here making grunting sounds basically, and hopefully constructing a similar messy, confused idea in your head that bears some analogy to it.
But we're taking something very complicated, turning it into sound, sequences of sounds, and producing something very complicated in your brain.
So this allows us now to begin to start functioning as a single organism.
And so, in fact, what we've done is we, humanity, have started abstracting out.
We're going through the same levels that multi-cellular organisms have gone through — abstracting out our methods of recording, presenting, processing information.
So for example, the invention of language was a tiny step in that direction.
Telephony, computers, videotapes, CD-ROMs and so on are all our specialized mechanisms that we've now built within our society for handling that information.
And it all connects us together into something that is much bigger and much faster and able to evolve than what we were before.
So now, evolution can take place on a scale of microseconds.
And you saw Ty's little evolutionary example where he sort of did a little bit of evolution on the Convolution program right before your eyes.
So now we've speeded up the time scales once again.
So the first steps of the story that I told you about took a billion years a piece.
And the next steps, like nervous systems and brains, took a few hundred million years.
Then the next steps, like language and so on, took less than a million years.
And these next steps, like electronics, seem to be taking only a few decades.
The process is feeding on itself and becoming, I guess, autocatalytic is the word for it — when something reinforces its rate of change.
The more it changes, the faster it changes.
And I think that that's what we're seeing here in this explosion of curve.
We're seeing this process feeding back on itself.
Now I design computers for a living, and I know that the mechanisms that I use to design computers would be impossible without recent advances in computers.
So right now, what I do is I design objects at such complexity that it's really impossible for me to design them in the traditional sense.
I don't know what every transistor in the connection machine does.
There are billions of them.
Instead, what I do and what the designers at Thinking Machines do is we think at some level of abstraction and then we hand it to the machine and the machine takes it beyond what we could ever do, much farther and faster than we could ever do.
And in fact, sometimes it takes it by methods that we don't quite even understand.
One method that's particularly interesting that I've been using a lot lately is evolution itself.
So what we do is we put inside the machine a process of evolution that takes place on the microsecond time scale.
So for example, in the most extreme cases, we can actually evolve a program by starting out with random sequences of instructions.
Say, "Computer, would you please make a hundred million random sequences of instructions.
Now would you please run all of those random sequences of instructions, run all of those programs, and pick out the ones that came closest to doing what I wanted. "So in other words, I define what I wanted.
Let's say I want to sort numbers, as a simple example I've done it with.
So find the programs that come closest to sorting numbers.
So of course, random sequences of instructions are very unlikely to sort numbers, so none of them will really do it.
But one of them, by luck, may put two numbers in the right order.
And I say, "Computer, would you please now take the 10 percent of those random sequences that did the best job. Save those. Kill off the rest.
And now let's reproduce the ones that sorted numbers the best.
And let's reproduce them by a process of recombination analogous to sex. "Take two programs and they produce children by exchanging their subroutines, and the children inherit the traits of the subroutines of the two programs.
So I've got now a new generation of programs that are produced by combinations of the programs that did a little bit better job.
Say, "Please repeat that process." Score them again.
Introduce some mutations perhaps.
And try that again and do that for another generation.
So I can do the equivalent of millions of years of evolution on that within the computer in a few minutes, or in the complicated cases, in a few hours.
At the end of that, I end up with programs that are absolutely perfect at sorting numbers.
In fact, they are programs that are much more efficient than programs I could have ever written by hand.
Now if I look at those programs, I can't tell you how they work.
I've tried looking at them and telling you how they work.
They're obscure, weird programs.
But they do the job.
And in fact, I know, I'm very confident that they do the job because they come from a line of hundreds of thousands of programs that did the job.
In fact, their life depended on doing the job.
(Laughter)
I was riding in a 747 with Marvin Minsky once, and he pulls out this card and says, "Oh look. Look at this. It says, 'This plane has hundreds of thousands of tiny parts working together to make you a safe flight.' Doesn't that make you feel confident?"
(Laughter)
In fact, we know that the engineering process doesn't work very well when it gets complicated.
So we're beginning to depend on computers to do a process that's very different than engineering.
And it lets us produce things of much more complexity than normal engineering lets us produce.
And yet, we don't quite understand the options of it.
So in a sense, it's getting ahead of us.
We're now using those programs to make much faster computers so that we'll be able to run this process much faster.
So it's feeding back on itself.
The thing is becoming faster and that's why I think it seems so confusing.
Because all of these technologies are feeding back on themselves. We're taking off.
And what we are is we're at a point in time which is analogous to when single-celled organisms were turning into multi-celled organisms.
So we're the amoebas and we can't quite figure out what the hell this thing is we're creating.
We're right at that point of transition.
But I think that there really is something coming along after us.
I think it's very haughty of us to think that we're the end product of evolution.
And I think all of us here are a part of producing whatever that next thing is.
So lunch is coming along, and I think I will stop at that point, before I get selected out.
(Applause)
I'm here to share my photography.
Or is it photography?
Because, of course, this is a photograph that you can't take with your camera.
Yet, my interest in photography started as I got my first digital camera at the age of 15.
It mixed with my earlier passion for drawing, but it was a bit different, because using the camera, the process was in the planning instead.
And when you take a photograph with a camera, the process ends when you press the trigger.
So to me it felt like photography was more about being at the right place and the right time.
I felt like anyone could do that.
So I wanted to create something different, something where the process starts when you press the trigger.
Photos like this: construction going on along a busy road.
But it has an unexpected twist.
And despite that, it retains a level of realism.
Or photos like these — both dark and colorful, but all with a common goal of retaining the level of realism.
When I say realism, I mean photo-realism.
Because, of course, it's not something you can capture really, but I always want it to look like it could have been captured somehow as a photograph.
Photos where you will need a brief moment to think to figure out the trick.
So it's more about capturing an idea than about capturing a moment really.
But what's the trick that makes it look realistic?
Is it something about the details or the colors?
Is it something about the light?
What creates the illusion?
Sometimes the perspective is the illusion.
But in the end, it comes down to how we interpret the world and how it can be realized on a two-dimensional surface.
It's not really what is realistic, it's what we think looks realistic really.
So I think the basics are quite simple.
I just see it as a puzzle of reality where you can take different pieces of reality and put it together to create alternate reality.
And let me show you a simple example.
Here we have three perfectly imaginable physical objects, something we all can relate to living in a three-dimensional world.
But combined in a certain way, they can create something that still looks three-dimensional, like it could exist.
But at the same time, we know it can't.
So we trick our brains, because our brain simply doesn't accept the fact that it doesn't really make sense.
And I see the same process with combining photographs.
It's just really about combining different realities.
So the things that make a photograph look realistic, I think it's the things that we don't even think about, the things all around us in our daily lives.
But when combining photographs, this is really important to consider, because otherwise it just looks wrong somehow.
So I would like to say that there are three simple rules to follow to achieve a realistic result.
As you can see, these images aren't really special.
But combined, they can create something like this.
So the first rule is that photos combined should have the same perspective.
Secondly, photos combined should have the same type of light.
And these two images both fulfill these two requirements — shot at the same height and in the same type of light.
The third one is about making it impossible to distinguish where the different images begin and end by making it seamless.
Make it impossible to say how the image actually was composed.
So by matching color, contrast and brightness in the borders between the different images, adding photographic defects like depth of field, desaturated colors and noise, we erase the borders between the different images and make it look like one single image, despite the fact that one image can contain hundreds of layers basically.
So here's another example. (Laughter) One might think that this is just an image of a landscape and the lower part is what's manipulated.
But this image is actually entirely composed of photographs from different locations.
I personally think that it's easier to actually create a place than to find a place, because then you don't need to compromise with the ideas in your head.
But it does require a lot of planning.
And getting this idea during winter, I knew that I had several months to plan it, to find the different locations for the pieces of the puzzle basically.
So for example, the fish was captured on a fishing trip.
The shores are from a different location.
The underwater part was captured in a stone pit.
And yeah, I even turned the house on top of the island red to make it look more Swedish.
So to achieve a realistic result, I think it comes down to planning.
It always starts with a sketch, an idea.
Then it's about combining the different photographs.
And here every piece is very well planned.
And if you do a good job capturing the photos, the result can be quite beautiful and also quite realistic.
So all the tools are out there, and the only thing that limits us is our imagination.
Thank you.
(Applause)
I would like to talk to you about why many ehealth projects fail.
And I really think that the most important thing of it is that we stopped listening to patients.
And one thing we did at Radboud University is we appointed a Chief Listening Officer.
Not in a very scientific way — she puts up a little cup of coffee or a cup of tea and asks patients, family, relatives, "What's up?
How could we help you? "And we think, we like to think, that this is one of the major problems why all — maybe not all — but most of the ehealth projects fail, since we stopped listening.
This is my weight scale.
It's a very simple thing.
It's got one knob, on / off.
And every morning I hop on it.
And yes, I've got a challenge, as you might see.
And I put my challenge on 95 kg.
But the thing is that it's made this simple that whenever I hop on, it sends my data to Google Health as well.
And it's collected by my general practitioner as well, so he can see what's my problem in weight, not on the very moment that I need cardiologic support or something like it, but also looking backward.
But there's another thing.
As some of you might know, I've got more than 4000 followers on Twitter.
So every morning, I hop on my weight scale and before I'm in my car, people start talking to me, "I think you need a light lunch today, Lucien."
(Laughter)
But that's the nicest thing that could happen, since this is peer pressure. Peer pressure used to help patients — since this could be used for obesity, it could be used to stop patients from smoking.
But on the other hand, it also could be used to get people out of their chairs and try to work together in some kind of gaming activity to get more control of their health.
As of next week, it will soon be available, there will be this little blood-pressure meter connected to an iPhone or something or other.
And people will be able, from their homes, to take their blood pressure, send it to their doctor and eventually share it with others, for instance, for over a 100 dollars.
And this is the point where patients get into position and can collect, not only their own control again, be captain of their own ship, but also can help us in health care due to the challenges that we face, like health-care cost explosion, doubled demand and things like that, make techniques that are easy to use and start with this to embrace patients in the team.
And you can do this with techniques like this, but also by crowdsourcing.
And one of the things we did, that I would like to share with you introduced by a little video.
We've all got navigation controls in our car.
We maybe even have it in our cellphone.
We perfectly know where all the ATMs are, just about the city of Maastricht.
The other thing is we know where all the gas stations are.
And sure, we could find fast food chains.
But where would be the nearest AED to help this patient?
We asked around, and nobody knew.
Nobody knew where the nearest lifesaving AED was to be obtained right now.
So what we did, we crowdsourced the Netherlands.
We set up a website, and asked the crowd, "If you see an AED, please submit it, tell us where it is, tell us when it's open," since sometimes in office hours it's closed, of course.
And over 10,000 AEDs in the Netherlands already have been submitted.
The next step we took was to find the applications for it.
And we built an iPad application.
We made an application for Layar: Augmented Reality, to find these AEDs.
And whenever you are in a city like Maastricht, and somebody collapses, you can use your iPhone, and within the next weeks also your Microsoft cellphone, to find the nearest AED, which can save lives.
And as of today, we would like to introduce this, not only as AED4EU, which is what the product is called, but also AED4US.
And we would like to start this on a worldwide level.
And ask all of our colleagues in the rest of the world, colleague universities, to help us to find and work and act like a hub to crowdsource all these AEDs all around the world, that whenever you're on holiday and somebody collapses, might it be your own relative or someone just in front of you, you can find this.
The other thing we would like to ask is of companies also all over the world that will be able to help us validate these AEDs.
These might be courier services or cable guys, for instance, just to see whether the AED that is submitted is still in place.
So please help us on this one and try to make not only health a little bit better, but take control of it.
Thank you.
(Applause)
My story begins right here actually in Rajasthan about two years ago.
I was in the desert, under the starry skies with the Sufi singer Mukhtiar Ali.
And we were in conversation about how nothing had changed since the time of the ancient Indian epic "The Mahabharata."
So back in the day, when us Indians wanted to travel we'd jump into a chariot and we'd zoom across the sky.
Now we do the same with airplanes.
Back then, when Arjuna, the great Indian warrior prince, when he was thirsty, he'd take out a bow, he'd shoot it into the ground and water would come out.
Now we do the same with drills and machines.
The conclusion that we came to was that magic had been replaced by machinery.
And this made me really sad.
I found myself becoming a little bit of a technophobe.
I was terrified by this idea that I would lose the ability to enjoy and appreciate the sunset without having my camera on me, without tweeting it to my friends.
And it felt like technology should enable magic, not kill it.
When I was a little girl, my grandfather gave me his little silver pocket watch.
And this piece of 50-year-old technology became the most magical thing to me.
It became a gilded gateway into a world full of pirates and shipwrecks and images in my imagination.
So I felt like our cellphones and our fancy watches and our cameras had stopped us from dreaming.
They stopped us from being inspired.
And so I jumped in, I jumped into this world of technology, to see how I could use it to enable magic as opposed to kill it.
I've been illustrating books since I was 16.
And so when I saw the iPad, I saw it as a storytelling device that could connect readers all over the world.
It can know how we're holding it.
It can know where we are.
It brings together image and text and animation and sound and touch.
Storytelling is becoming more and more multi-sensorial.
But what are we doing with it?
So I'm actually just going to go in and launch Khoya, an interactive app for the iPad.
So it says, "Place your fingers upon each light." And so — (Music) It says, "This box belongs to..." And so I type in my name.
And actually I become a character in the book.
At various points, a little letter drops down to me — and the iPad knows where you live because of GPS — which is actually addressed to me.
The child in me is really excited by these kinds of possibilities.
Now I've been talking a lot about magic.
And I don't mean wizards and dragons, I mean the kind of childhood magic, those ideas that we all harbored as children.
This idea of fireflies in a jar, for some reason, was always really exciting to me.
And so over here you need to tilt your iPad, take the fireflies out.
And they actually illuminate your way through the rest of the book.
Another idea that really fascinated me as a child was that an entire galaxy could be contained within a single marble.
And so over here, each book and each world becomes a little marble that I drag in to this magical device within the device.
And it opens up a map.
All along, all fantasy books have always had maps, but these maps have been static.
This is a map that grows and glows and becomes your navigation for the rest of the book.
It reveals itself to you at certain points in the book as well.
So I'm just going to enter in.
Another thing that's actually really important to me is creating content that is Indian and yet very contemporary.
Over here, these are the Apsaras.
So we've all heard about fairies and we've all heard about nymphs, but how many people outside of India know about their Indian counterparts, the Apsaras?
These poor Apsaras have been trapped inside Indra's chambers for thousands of years in an old and musty book.
And so we're bringing them back in a contemporary story for children.
And a story that actually deals with new issues like the environmental crisis. (Music)
Speaking of the environmental crisis, I think a big problem has been in the last 10 years is that children have been locked inside their rooms, glued to their PCs, they haven't been able to get out.
But now with mobile technology, we can actually take our children outside into the natural world with their technology.
One of the interactions in the book is that you're sent off on this quest where you need to go outside, take out your camera on the iPad and collect pictures of different natural objects.
When I was a child, I had multiple collections of sticks and stones and pebbles and shells.
And somehow kids don't do that anymore.
So in bringing back this childhood ritual, you need to go out and, in one chapter, take a picture of a flower and then tag it.
In another chapter, you need to take a picture of a piece of bark and then tag that.
And what happens is that you actually create a digital collection of photographs that you can then put up online.
A child in London puts up a picture of a fox and says, "Oh, I saw a fox today." A child in India says, "I saw a monkey today." And it creates this kind of social network around a collection of digital photographs that you've actually taken.
In the possibilities of linking together magic, the earth and technology, there are multiple possibilities.
In the next book, we plan on having an interaction where you take your iPad out with the video on and through augmented reality, you see this layer of animated pixies appear on a houseplant that's outside your house.
At one point, your screen is filled up with leaves.
And so you need to make the sound of wind and blow them away and read the rest of the book.
We're moving, we're all moving here, to a world where the forces of nature come closer together to technology, and magic and technology can come closer together.
We're harnessing energy from the sun.
We're bringing our children and ourselves closer to the natural world and that magic and joy and childhood love that we had through the simple medium of a story.
Thank you.
(Applause)
How can I speak in 10 minutes about the bonds of women over three generations, about how the astonishing strength of those bonds took hold in the life of a four-year-old girl huddled with her young sister, her mother and her grandmother for five days and nights in a small boat in the China Sea more than 30 years ago.
Bonds that took hold in the life of that small girl and never let go — that small girl now living in San Francisco and speaking to you today.
This is not a finished story.
It is a jigsaw puzzle still being put together.
Let me tell you about some of the pieces.
Imagine the first piece: a man burning his life's work.
He is a poet, a playwright, a man whose whole life had been balanced on the single hope of his country's unity and freedom.
Imagine him as the communists enter Saigon — confronting the fact that his life had been a complete waste.
Words, for so long his friends, now mocked him.
He retreated into silence.
He died broken by history.
He is my grandfather.
I never knew him in real life.
But our lives are much more than our memories.
My grandmother never let me forget his life.
My duty was not to allow it to have been in vain, and my lesson was to learn that, yes, history tried to crush us, but we endured.
The next piece of the jigsaw is of a boat in the early dawn slipping silently out to sea.
My mother, Mai, was 18 when her father died — already in an arranged marriage, already with two small girls.
For her, life had distilled itself into one task: the escape of her family and a new life in Australia.
It was inconceivable to her that she would not succeed.
So after a four-year saga that defies fiction, a boat slipped out to sea disguised as a fishing vessel.
All the adults knew the risks.
The greatest fear was of pirates, rape and death.
Like most adults on the boat, my mother carried a small bottle of poison.
If we were captured, first my sister and I, then she and my grandmother would drink.
My first memories are from the boat — the steady beat of the engine, the bow dipping into each wave, the vast and empty horizon.
I don't remember the pirates who came many times, but were bluffed by the bravado of the men on our boat, or the engine dying and failing to start for six hours.
But I do remember the lights on the oil rig off the Malaysian coast and the young man who collapsed and died, the journey's end too much for him, and the first apple I tasted, given to me by the men on the rig.
No apple has ever tasted the same.
After three months in a refugee camp, we landed in Melbourne.
And the next piece of the jigsaw is about four women across three generations shaping a new life together.
We settled in Footscray, a working-class suburb whose demographic is layers of immigrants.
Unlike the settled middle-class suburbs, whose existence I was oblivious of, there was no sense of entitlement in Footscray.
The smells from shop doors were from the rest of the world.
And the snippets of halting English were exchanged between people who had one thing in common: They were starting again.
My mother worked on farms, then on a car assembly line, working six days, double shifts.
Somehow, she found time to study English and gain IT qualifications. We were poor. All the dollars were allocated and extra tuition in English and mathematics was budgeted for regardless of what missed out, which was usually new clothes; they were always secondhand.
Two pairs of stockings for school, each to hide the holes in the other.
A school uniform down to the ankles, because it had to last for six years.
And there were rare but searing chants of "slit-eye" and the occasional graffiti: "Asian, go home." Go home to where?
Something stiffened inside me.
There was a gathering of resolve and a quiet voice saying, "I will bypass you."
My mother, my sister and I slept in the same bed.
My mother was exhausted each night, but we told one another about our day and listened to the movements of my grandmother around the house.
My mother suffered from nightmares, all about the boat.
And my job was to stay awake until her nightmares came so I could wake her.
She opened a computer store, then studied to be a beautician and opened another business.
And the women came with their stories about men who could not make the transition, angry and inflexible, and troubled children caught between two worlds.
Grants and sponsors were sought. Centers were established. I lived in parallel worlds.
In one, I was the classic Asian student, relentless in the demands that I made on myself.
In the other, I was enmeshed in lives that were precarious, tragically scarred by violence, drug abuse and isolation.
But so many over the years were helped.
And for that work, when I was a final-year law student, I was chosen as the Young Australian of the Year.
And I was catapulted from one piece of the jigsaw to another, and their edges didn't fit.
Tan Le, anonymous Footscray resident, was now Tan Le, refugee and social activist, invited to speak in venues she had never heard of and into homes whose existence she could never have imagined.
I didn't know the protocols.
I didn't know how to use the cutlery.
I didn't know how to talk about wine.
I didn't know how to talk about anything.
I wanted to retreat to the routines and comfort of life in an unsung suburb — a grandmother, a mother and two daughters ending each day as they had for almost 20 years, telling one another the story of their day and falling asleep, the three of us still in the same bed.
I told my mother I couldn't do it.
She reminded me that I was now the same age she had been when we boarded the boat. "No" had never been an option. "Just do it," she said, "and don't be what you're not."
So I spoke out on youth unemployment and education and the neglect of the marginalized and disenfranchised.
And the more candidly I spoke, the more I was asked to speak.
I met people from all walks of life, so many of them doing the thing they loved, living on the frontiers of possibility.
And even though I finished my degree, I realized I could not settle into a career in law.
There had to be another piece of the jigsaw.
And I realized, at the same time, that it is OK to be an outsider, a recent arrival, new on the scene — and not just OK, but something to be thankful for, perhaps a gift from the boat.
Because being an insider can so easily mean collapsing the horizons, can so easily mean accepting the presumptions of your province.
I have stepped outside my comfort zone enough now to know that, yes, the world does fall apart, but not in the way that you fear.
Possibilities that would not have been allowed were outrageously encouraged.
There was an energy there, an implacable optimism, a strange mixture of humility and daring.
So I followed my hunches.
I gathered around me a small team of people for whom the label "It can't be done" was an irresistible challenge.
For a year, we were penniless.
At the end of each day, I made a huge pot of soup which we all shared.
We worked well into each night.
Most of our ideas were crazy, but a few were brilliant, and we broke through.
I made the decision to move to the US after only one trip. My hunches again. Three months later, I had relocated, and the adventure has continued.
Before I close, though, let me tell you about my grandmother.
She grew up at a time when Confucianism was the social norm and the local mandarin was the person who mattered.
Life hadn't changed for centuries.
Her father died soon after she was born.
Her mother raised her alone.
At 17, she became the second wife of a mandarin whose mother beat her.
With no support from her husband, she caused a sensation by taking him to court and prosecuting her own case, and a far greater sensation when she won. (Laughter) (Applause) "It can't be done" was shown to be wrong.
I was taking a shower in a hotel room in Sydney the moment she died, 600 miles away, in Melbourne.
I looked through the shower screen and saw her standing on the other side.
I knew she had come to say goodbye.
My mother phoned minutes later.
A few days later, we went to a Buddhist temple in Footscray and sat around her casket.
We told her stories and assured her that we were still with her.
At midnight, the monk came and told us he had to close the casket.
My mother asked us to feel her hand.
She asked the monk, "Why is it that her hand is so warm and the rest of her is so cold?" "Because you have been holding it since this morning," he said. "You have not let it go."
If there is a sinew in our family, it runs through the women.
Given who we were and how life had shaped us, we can now see that the men that might have come into our lives would have thwarted us.
Defeat would have come too easily.
Now I would like to have my own children, and I wonder about the boat.
Who could ever wish it on their own?
Yet I am afraid of privilege, of ease, of entitlement.
Can I give them a bow in their lives, dipping bravely into each wave, the unperturbed and steady beat of the engine, the vast horizon that guarantees nothing?
I don't know.
But if I could give it and still see them safely through, I would.
(Applause)
Trevor Neilson: And also, Tan's mother is here today, in the fourth or fifth row.
Hi. I'm Kevin Allocca, I'm the trends manager at YouTube, and I professionally watch YouTube videos. It's true. So we're going to talk a little bit today about how videos go viral and then why that even matters.
We all want to be stars — celebrities, singers, comedians — and when I was younger, that seemed so very, very hard to do.
But now Web video has made it so that any of us or any of the creative things that we do can become completely famous in a part of our world's culture.
Any one of you could be famous on the Internet by next Saturday.
But there are over 48 hours of video uploaded to YouTube every minute.
And of that, only a tiny percentage ever goes viral and gets tons of views and becomes a cultural moment.
So how does it happen?
Three things: tastemakers, communities of participation and unexpectedness.
All right, let's go.
(Video) Bear Vasquez: Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God! Wooo! Ohhhhh, wowwww!
KA: Last year, Bear Vasquez posted this video that he had shot outside his home in Yosemite National Park.
In 2010, it was viewed 23 million times. (Laughter) This is a chart of what it looked like when it first became popular last summer.
But he didn't actually set out to make a viral video, Bear.
He just wanted to share a rainbow. Because that's what you do when your name is Yosemite Mountain Bear. (Laughter) And he had posted lots of nature videos in fact.
And this video had actually been posted all the way back in January.
So what happened here? Jimmy Kimmel actually. Jimmy Kimmel posted this tweet that would eventually propel the video to be as popular as it would become.
Because tastemakers like Jimmy Kimmel introduce us to new and interesting things and bring them to a larger audience.
(Video) Rebecca Black: ♫ It's Friday, Friday.
Gotta get down on Friday.
♫ ♫ Everybody's looking forward to the weekend, weekend.
♫ ♫ Friday, Friday.
Gettin 'down on Friday. ♫
KA: So you didn't think that we could actually have this conversation without talking about this video I hope.
Rebecca Black's "Friday" is one of the most popular videos of the year.
It's been seen nearly 200 million times this year.
This is a chart of what it looked like.
And similar to "Double Rainbow," it seems to have just sprouted up out of nowhere.
So what happened on this day?
Well it was a Friday, this is true.
And if you're wondering about those other spikes, those are also Fridays. (Laughter) But what about this day, this one particular Friday?
Well Tosh.0 picked it up, a lot of blogs starting writing about.
Michael J. Nelson from Mystery Science Theater was one of the first people to post a joke about the video on Twitter.
But what's important is that an individual or a group of tastemakers took a point of view and they shared that with a larger audience, accelerating the process.
And so then this community formed of people who shared this big inside joke and they started talking about it and doing things with it.
And now there are 10,000 parodies of "Friday" on YouTube.
Even in the first seven days, there was one parody for every other day of the week. (Laughter) Unlike the one-way entertainment of the 20th century, this community participation is how we become a part of the phenomenon — either by spreading it or by doing something new with it.
(Music)
So "Nyan Cat" is a looped animation with looped music.
It's this, just like this.
It's been viewed nearly 50 million times this year.
And if you think that that is weird, you should know that there is a three-hour version of this that's been viewed four million times. (Laughter) Even cats were watching this video. (Laughter) Cats were watching other cats watch this video.
(Laughter)
But what's important here is the creativity that it inspired amongst this techie, geeky Internet culture.
There were remixes. (Laughter) Someone made an old timey version. (Laughter) And then it went international. (Laughter) An entire remix community sprouted up that brought it from being just a stupid joke to something that we can all actually be a part of.
Because we don't just enjoy now, we participate.
And who could have predicted any of this?
Who could have predicted "Double Rainbow" or Rebecca Black or "Nyan Cat?" What scripts could you have written that would have contained this in it?
In a world where over two days of video get uploaded every minute, only that which is truly unique and unexpected can stand out in the way that these things have.
When a friend of mine told me that I needed to see this great video about a guy protesting bicycle fines in New York City, I admit I wasn't very interested.
(Video) Casey Niestat: So I got a ticket for not riding in the bike lane, but often there are obstructions that keep you from properly riding in the bike lane.
(Laughter)
KA: By being totally surprising and humorous, Casey Niestat got his funny idea and point seen five million times.
And so this approach holds for anything new that we do creatively.
And so it all brings us to one big question...
(Video) Bear Vasquez: What does this mean?
Ohhhh. (Laughter)
KA: What does it mean?
Tastemakers, creative participating communities, complete unexpectedness, these are characteristics of a new kind of media and a new kind of culture where anyone has access and the audience defines the popularity.
I mean, as mentioned earlier, one of the biggest stars in the world right now, Justin Bieber, got his start on YouTube.
No one has to green-light your idea.
And we all now feel some ownership in our own pop culture.
And these are not characteristics of old media, and they're barely true of the media of today, but they will define the entertainment of the future.
Thank you.

(Video) Announcer: Threats, in the wake of Bin Laden's death, have spiked.
Announcer Two: Famine in Somalia.
Announcer Three: Police pepper spray.
Announcer Four: Vicious cartels.
Announcer Five: Caustic cruise lines.
Announcer Six: Societal decay.
Announcer Seven: 65 dead.
Announcer Eight: Tsunami warning.
Announcer Nine: Cyberattacks. Multiple Announcers: Drug war. Mass destruction. Tornado. Recession. Default. Doomsday. Egypt. Syria. Crisis. Death. Disaster. Oh, my God.
Peter Diamandis: So those are just a few of the clips I collected over the last six months — could have easily been the last six days or the last six years.
The point is that the news media preferentially feeds us negative stories because that's what our minds pay attention to.
And there's a very good reason for that.
Every second of every day, our senses bring in way too much data than we can possibly process in our brains.
And because nothing is more important to us than survival, the first stop of all of that data is an ancient sliver of the temporal lobe called the amygdala.
Now the amygdala is our early warning detector, our danger detector.
It sorts and scours through all of the information looking for anything in the environment that might harm us.
So given a dozen news stories, we will preferentially look at the negative news.
And that old newspaper saying, "If it bleeds it leads," is very true.
So given all of our digital devices that are bringing all the negative news to us seven days a week, 24 hours a day, it's no wonder that we're pessimistic.
It's no wonder that people think that the world is getting worse.
But perhaps that's not the case.
Perhaps instead, it's the distortions brought to us of what's really going on.
Perhaps the tremendous progress we've made over the last century by a series of forces are, in fact, accelerating to a point that we have the potential in the next three decades to create a world of abundance.
Now I'm not saying we don't have our set of problems — climate crisis, species extinction, water and energy shortage — we surely do.
And as humans, we are far better at seeing the problems way in advance, but ultimately we knock them down.
So let's look at what this last century has been to see where we're going.
Over the last hundred years, the average human lifespan has more than doubled, average per capita income adjusted for inflation around the world has tripled.
Childhood mortality has come down a factor of 10.
Add to that the cost of food, electricity, transportation, communication have dropped 10 to 1,000-fold.
Steve Pinker has showed us that, in fact, we're living during the most peaceful time ever in human history.
And Charles Kenny that global literacy has gone from 25 percent to over 80 percent in the last 130 years.
We truly are living in an extraordinary time.
And many people forget this.
And we keep setting our expectations higher and higher.
In fact, we redefine what poverty means.
Think of this, in America today, the majority of people under the poverty line still have electricity, water, toilets, refrigerators, television, mobile phones, air conditioning and cars.
The wealthiest robber barons of the last century, the emperors on this planet, could have never dreamed of such luxuries.
Underpinning much of this is technology, and of late, exponentially growing technologies.
My good friend Ray Kurzweil showed that any tool that becomes an information technology jumps on this curve, on Moore's Law, and experiences price performance doubling every 12 to 24 months.
That's why the cellphone in your pocket is literally a million times cheaper and a thousand times faster than a supercomputer of the '70s.
Now look at this curve.
This is Moore's Law over the last hundred years.
I want you to notice two things from this curve.
Number one, how smooth it is — through good time and bad time, war time and peace time, recession, depression and boom time.
This is the result of faster computers being used to build faster computers.
It doesn't slow for any of our grand challenges.
And also, even though it's plotted on a log curve on the left, it's curving upwards.
The rate at which the technology is getting faster is itself getting faster.
Cloud computing, what my friends at Autodesk call infinite computing; sensors and networks; robotics; 3D printing, which is the ability to democratize and distribute personalized production around the planet; synthetic biology; fuels, vaccines and foods; digital medicine; nanomaterials; and A.I. I mean, how many of you saw the winning of Jeopardy by IBM's Watson?
I mean, that was epic.
In fact, I scoured the headlines looking for the best headline in a newspaper I could.
And I love this: "Watson Vanquishes Human Opponents." Jeopardy's not an easy game.
It's about the nuance of human language.
And imagine if you would A.I. 's like this on the cloud available to every person with a cellphone.
Four years ago here at TED, Ray Kurzweil and I started a new university called Singularity University.
And we teach our students all of these technologies, and particularly how they can be used to solve humanity's grand challenges.
And every year we ask them to start a company or a product or a service that can affect positively the lives of a billion people within a decade.
Think about that, the fact that, literally, a group of students can touch the lives of a billion people today.
30 years ago that would have sounded ludicrous.
Today we can point at dozens of companies that have done just that.
When I think about creating abundance, it's not about creating a life of luxury for everybody on this planet; it's about creating a life of possibility.
It is about taking that which was scarce and making it abundant.
You see, scarcity is contextual, and technology is a resource-liberating force.
Let me give you an example.
So this is a story of Napoleon III in the mid-1800s.
He's the dude on the left.
He invited over to dinner the king of Siam.
All of Napoleon's troops were fed with silver utensils, Napoleon himself with gold utensils.
But the King of Siam, he was fed with aluminum utensils.
You see, aluminum was the most valuable metal on the planet, worth more than gold and platinum.
It's the reason that the tip of the Washington Monument is made of aluminum.
You see, even though aluminum is 8.3 percent of the Earth by mass, it doesn't come as a pure metal.
It's all bound by oxygen and silicates.
But then the technology of electrolysis came along and literally made aluminum so cheap that we use it with throw-away mentality.
So let's project this analogy going forward.
We think about energy scarcity.
Ladies and gentlemen, we are on a planet that is bathed with 5,000 times more energy than we use in a year.
16 terawatts of energy hits the Earth's surface every 88 minutes.
It's not about being scarce, it's about accessibility.
And there's good news here.
For the first time, this year the cost of solar-generated electricity is 50 percent that of diesel-generated electricity in India — 8.8 rupees versus 17 rupees.
The cost of solar dropped 50 percent last year.
Last month, MIT put out a study showing that by the end of this decade, in the sunny parts of the United States, solar electricity will be six cents a kilowatt hour compared to 15 cents as a national average.
And if we have abundant energy, we also have abundant water.
Now we talk about water wars.
Do you remember when Carl Sagan turned the Voyager spacecraft back towards the Earth, in 1990 after it just passed Saturn?
He took a famous photo.
What was it called? "A Pale Blue Dot." Because we live on a water planet.
We live on a planet 70 percent covered by water.
Yes, 97.5 percent is saltwater, two percent is ice, and we fight over a half a percent of the water on this planet, but here too there is hope.
And there is technology coming online, not 10, 20 years from now, right now.
There's nanotechnology coming on, nanomaterials.
And the conversation I had with Dean Kamen this morning, one of the great DIY innovators, I'd like to share with you — he gave me permission to do so — his technology called Slingshot that many of you may have heard of, it is the size of a small dorm room refrigerator.
It's able to generate a thousand liters of clean drinking water a day out of any source — saltwater, polluted water, latrine — at less than two cents a liter.
The chairman of Coca-Cola has just agreed to do a major test of hundreds of units of this in the developing world.
And if that pans out, which I have every confidence it will, Coca-Cola will deploy this globally to 206 countries around the planet.
This is the kind of innovation, empowered by this technology, that exists today.
And we've seen this in cellphones.
My goodness, we're going to hit 70 percent penetration of cellphones in the developing world by the end of 2013.
Think about it, that a Masai warrior on a cellphone in the middle of Kenya has better mobile comm than President Reagan did 25 years ago.
And if they're on a smartphone on Google, they've got access to more knowledge and information than President Clinton did 15 years ago.
They're living in a world of information and communication abundance that no one could have ever predicted.
Better than that, the things that you and I spent tens and hundreds of thousands of dollars for — GPS, HD video and still images, libraries of books and music, medical diagnostic technology — are now literally dematerializing and demonetizing into your cellphone.
Probably the best part of it is what's coming down the pike in health.
Last month, I had the pleasure of announcing with Qualcomm Foundation something called the $10 million Qualcomm Tricorder X Prize.
We're challenging teams around the world to basically combine these technologies into a mobile device that you can speak to, because it's got A.I., you can cough on it, you can do a finger blood prick.
And to win, it needs to be able to diagnose you better than a team of board-certified doctors.
So literally, imagine this device in the middle of the developing world where there are no doctors, 25 percent of the disease burden and 1.3 percent of the health care workers.
When this device sequences an RNA or DNA virus that it doesn't recognize, it calls the CDC and prevents the pandemic from happening in the first place.
But here, here is the biggest force for bringing about a world of abundance.
I call it the rising billion.
So the white lines here are population.
We just passed the seven billion mark on Earth.
And by the way, the biggest protection against a population explosion is making the world educated and healthy.
In 2010, we had just short of two billion people online, connected.
By 2020, that's going from two billion to five billion Internet users.
Three billion new minds who have never been heard from before are connecting to the global conversation.
What will these people want?
What will they consume?
What will they desire?
And rather than having economic shutdown, we're about to have the biggest economic injection ever.
These people represent tens of trillions of dollars injected into the global economy.
And they will get healthier by using the Tricorder, and they'll become better educated by using the Khan Academy, and by literally being able to use 3D printing and infinite computing [become] more productive than ever before.
So what could three billion rising, healthy, educated, productive members of humanity bring to us?
How about a set of voices that have never been heard from before.
What about giving the oppressed, wherever they might be, the voice to be heard and the voice to act for the first time ever?
What will these three billion people bring?
What about contributions we can't even predict?
The one thing I've learned at the X Prize is that small teams driven by their passion with a clear focus can do extraordinary things, things that large corporations and governments could only do in the past.
Let me share and close with a story that really got me excited.
There is a program that some of you might have heard of.
It's a game called Foldit.
It came out of the University of Washington in Seattle.
And this is a game where individuals can actually take a sequence of amino acids and figure out how the protein is going to fold.
And how it folds dictates its structure and its functionality.
And it's very important for research in medicine.
And up until now, it's been a supercomputer problem.
And this game has been played by university professors and so forth.
And it's literally, hundreds of thousands of people came online and started playing it.
And it showed that, in fact, today, the human pattern recognition machinery is better at folding proteins than the best computers.
And when these individuals went and looked at who was the best protein folder in the world, it wasn't an MIT professor, it wasn't a CalTech student, it was a person from England, from Manchester, a woman who, during the day, was an executive assistant at a rehab clinic and, at night, was the world's best protein folder.
Ladies and gentlemen, what gives me tremendous confidence in the future is the fact that we are now more empowered as individuals to take on the grand challenges of this planet.
We have the tools with this exponential technology.
We have the passion of the DIY innovator.
We have the capital of the techno-philanthropist.
And we have three billion new minds coming online to work with us to solve the grand challenges, to do that which we must do.
We are living into extraordinary decades ahead.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Well this is a really extraordinary honor for me.
I spend most of my time in jails, in prisons, on death row.
I spend most of my time in very low-income communities in the projects and places where there's a great deal of hopelessness.
And being here at TED and seeing the stimulation, hearing it, has been very, very energizing to me.
And one of the things that's emerged in my short time here is that TED has an identity.
And you can actually say things here that have impacts around the world.
And sometimes when it comes through TED, it has meaning and power that it doesn't have when it doesn't.
And I mention that because I think identity is really important.
And we've had some fantastic presentations.
And I think what we've learned is that, if you're a teacher your words can be meaningful, but if you're a compassionate teacher, they can be especially meaningful.
If you're a doctor you can do some good things, but if you're a caring doctor you can do some other things.
And so I want to talk about the power of identity.
And I didn't learn about this actually practicing law and doing the work that I do.
I actually learned about this from my grandmother.
I grew up in a house that was the traditional African-American home that was dominated by a matriarch, and that matriarch was my grandmother.
She was tough, she was strong, she was powerful.
She was the end of every argument in our family.
She was the beginning of a lot of arguments in our family.
She was the daughter of people who were actually enslaved.
Her parents were born in slavery in Virginia in the 1840's.
She was born in the 1880's and the experience of slavery very much shaped the way she saw the world.
And my grandmother was tough, but she was also loving.
When I would see her as a little boy, she'd come up to me and she'd give me these hugs.
And she'd squeeze me so tight I could barely breathe and then she'd let me go.
And an hour or two later, if I saw her, she'd come over to me and she'd say, "Bryan, do you still feel me hugging you?" And if I said, "No," she'd assault me again, and if I said, "Yes," she'd leave me alone.
And she just had this quality that you always wanted to be near her.
And the only challenge was that she had 10 children.
My mom was the youngest of her 10 kids.
And sometimes when I would go and spend time with her, it would be difficult to get her time and attention.
My cousins would be running around everywhere.
And I remember, when I was about eight or nine years old, waking up one morning, going into the living room, and all of my cousins were running around.
And my grandmother was sitting across the room staring at me.
And at first I thought we were playing a game.
And I would look at her and I'd smile, but she was very serious.
And after about 15 or 20 minutes of this, she got up and she came across the room and she took me by the hand and she said, "Come on, Bryan.
You and I are going to have a talk. "And I remember this just like it happened yesterday.
I never will forget it.
She took me out back and she said, "Bryan, I'm going to tell you something, but you don't tell anybody what I tell you." I said, "Okay, Mama." She said, "Now you make sure you don't do that." I said, "Sure." Then she sat me down and she looked at me and she said, "I want you to know I've been watching you." And she said, "I think you're special." She said, "I think you can do anything you want to do." I will never forget it.
And then she said, "I just need you to promise me three things, Bryan." I said, "Okay, Mama." She said, "The first thing I want you to promise me is that you'll always love your mom." She said, "That's my baby girl, and you have to promise me now you'll always take care of her." Well I adored my mom, so I said, "Yes, Mama.
I'll do that. "Then she said," The second thing I want you to promise me is that you'll always do the right thing even when the right thing is the hard thing. "And I thought about it and I said," Yes, Mama.
I'll do that. "Then finally she said," The third thing I want you to promise me is that you'll never drink alcohol. "(Laughter) Well I was nine years old, so I said," Yes, Mama.
I'll do that. "
I grew up in the country in the rural South, and I have a brother a year older than me and a sister a year younger.
When I was about 14 or 15, one day my brother came home and he had this six-pack of beer — I don't know where he got it — and he grabbed me and my sister and we went out in the woods.
And we were kind of just out there doing the stuff we crazily did.
And he had a sip of this beer and he gave some to my sister and she had some, and they offered it to me.
I said, "No, no, no. That's okay. You all go ahead. I'm not going to have any beer." My brother said, "Come on.
We're doing this today; you always do what we do.
I had some, your sister had some.
Have some beer. "I said," No, I don't feel right about that. Y'all go ahead.
Y'all go ahead. "And then my brother started staring at me.
He said, "What's wrong with you?
Have some beer. "Then he looked at me real hard and he said," Oh, I hope you're not still hung up on that conversation Mama had with you. "(Laughter) I said," Well, what are you talking about? "He said," Oh, Mama tells all the grandkids that they're special. "(Laughter) I was devastated.
(Laughter)
And I'm going to admit something to you.
I'm going to tell you something I probably shouldn't.
I know this might be broadcast broadly.
But I'm 52 years old, and I'm going to admit to you that I've never had a drop of alcohol. (Applause) I don't say that because I think that's virtuous; I say that because there is power in identity.
When we create the right kind of identity, we can say things to the world around us that they don't actually believe makes sense.
We can get them to do things that they don't think they can do.
When I thought about my grandmother, of course she would think all her grandkids were special.
My grandfather was in prison during prohibition.
My male uncles died of alcohol-related diseases.
And these were the things she thought we needed to commit to.
Well I've been trying to say something about our criminal justice system.
This country is very different today than it was 40 years ago.
In 1972, there were 300,000 people in jails and prisons.
Today, there are 2.3 million.
The United States now has the highest rate of incarceration in the world.
We have seven million people on probation and parole.
And mass incarceration, in my judgment, has fundamentally changed our world.
In poor communities, in communities of color there is this despair, there is this hopelessness, that is being shaped by these outcomes.
One out of three black men between the ages of 18 and 30 is in jail, in prison, on probation or parole.
In urban communities across this country — Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington — 50 to 60 percent of all young men of color are in jail or prison or on probation or parole.
Our system isn't just being shaped in these ways that seem to be distorting around race, they're also distorted by poverty.
We have a system of justice in this country that treats you much better if you're rich and guilty than if you're poor and innocent.
Wealth, not culpability, shapes outcomes.
And yet, we seem to be very comfortable.
The politics of fear and anger have made us believe that these are problems that are not our problems.
We've been disconnected. It's interesting to me.
We're looking at some very interesting developments in our work.
My state of Alabama, like a number of states, actually permanently disenfranchises you if you have a criminal conviction.
Right now in Alabama 34 percent of the black male population has permanently lost the right to vote.
We're actually projecting in another 10 years the level of disenfranchisement will be as high as it's been since prior to the passage of the Voting Rights Act.
And there is this stunning silence.
I represent children. A lot of my clients are very young.
The United States is the only country in the world where we sentence 13-year-old children to die in prison.
We have life imprisonment without parole for kids in this country.
And we're actually doing some litigation.
The only country in the world.
I represent people on death row.
It's interesting, this question of the death penalty.
In many ways, we've been taught to think that the real question is, do people deserve to die for the crimes they've committed?
And that's a very sensible question.
But there's another way of thinking about where we are in our identity.
The other way of thinking about it is not, do people deserve to die for the crimes they commit, but do we deserve to kill?
I mean, it's fascinating.
Death penalty in America is defined by error.
For every nine people who have been executed, we've actually identified one innocent person who's been exonerated and released from death row. A kind of astonishing error rate — one out of nine people innocent.
I mean, it's fascinating.
In aviation, we would never let people fly on airplanes if for every nine planes that took off one would crash.
But somehow we can insulate ourselves from this problem.
It's not our problem.
It's not our burden.
It's not our struggle.
I talk a lot about these issues.
I talk about race and this question of whether we deserve to kill.
And it's interesting, when I teach my students about African-American history, I tell them about slavery.
I tell them about terrorism, the era that began at the end of reconstruction that went on to World War II.
We don't really know very much about it.
But for African-Americans in this country, that was an era defined by terror.
In many communities, people had to worry about being lynched. They had to worry about being bombed.
It was the threat of terror that shaped their lives.
And these older people come up to me now and they say, "Mr. Stevenson, you give talks, you make speeches, you tell people to stop saying we're dealing with terrorism for the first time in our nation's history after 9 / 11." They tell me to say, "No, tell them that we grew up with that." And that era of terrorism, of course, was followed by segregation and decades of racial subordination and apartheid.
And yet, we have in this country this dynamic where we really don't like to talk about our problems.
We don't like to talk about our history.
And because of that, we really haven't understood what it's meant to do the things we've done historically.
We're constantly running into each other.
We're constantly creating tensions and conflicts.
We have a hard time talking about race, and I believe it's because we are unwilling to commit ourselves to a process of truth and reconciliation.
In South Africa, people understood that we couldn't overcome apartheid without a commitment to truth and reconciliation.
In Rwanda, even after the genocide, there was this commitment, but in this country we haven't done that.
I was giving some lectures in Germany about the death penalty.
It was fascinating because one of the scholars stood up after the presentation and said, "Well you know it's deeply troubling to hear what you're talking about." He said, "We don't have the death penalty in Germany.
And of course, we can never have the death penalty in Germany. "And the room got very quiet, and this woman said," There's no way, with our history, we could ever engage in the systematic killing of human beings.
It would be unconscionable for us to, in an intentional and deliberate way, set about executing people. "And I thought about that.
What would it feel like to be living in a world where the nation state of Germany was executing people, especially if they were disproportionately Jewish? I couldn't bear it.
And yet, in this country, in the states of the Old South, we execute people — where you're 11 times more likely to get the death penalty if the victim is white than if the victim is black, 22 times more likely to get it if the defendant is black and the victim is white — in the very states where there are buried in the ground the bodies of people who were lynched.
And yet, there is this disconnect.
Well I believe that our identity is at risk.
That when we actually don't care about these difficult things, the positive and wonderful things are nonetheless implicated. We love innovation. We love technology. We love creativity. We love entertainment. But ultimately, those realities are shadowed by suffering, abuse, degradation, marginalization.
And for me, it becomes necessary to integrate the two.
Because ultimately we are talking about a need to be more hopeful, more committed, more dedicated to the basic challenges of living in a complex world.
And for me that means spending time thinking and talking about the poor, the disadvantaged, those who will never get to TED.
But thinking about them in a way that is integrated in our own lives.
You know ultimately, we all have to believe things we haven't seen. We do. As rational as we are, as committed to intellect as we are.
Innovation, creativity, development comes not from the ideas in our mind alone.
They come from the ideas in our mind that are also fueled by some conviction in our heart.
And it's that mind-heart connection that I believe compels us to not just be attentive to all the bright and dazzly things, but also the dark and difficult things.
Vaclav Havel, the great Czech leader, talked about this.
He said, "When we were in Eastern Europe and dealing with oppression, we wanted all kinds of things, but mostly what we needed was hope, an orientation of the spirit, a willingness to sometimes be in hopeless places and be a witness."
Well that orientation of the spirit is very much at the core of what I believe even TED communities have to be engaged in.
There is no disconnect around technology and design that will allow us to be fully human until we pay attention to suffering, to poverty, to exclusion, to unfairness, to injustice.
Now I will warn you that this kind of identity is a much more challenging identity than ones that don't pay attention to this.
It will get to you.
I had the great privilege, when I was a young lawyer, of meeting Rosa Parks. And Ms. Parks used to come back to Montgomery every now and then, and she would get together with two of her dearest friends, these older women, Johnnie Carr who was the organizer of the Montgomery bus boycott — amazing African-American woman — and Virginia Durr, a white woman, whose husband, Clifford Durr, represented Dr. King.
And these women would get together and just talk.
And every now and then Ms. Carr would call me, and she'd say, "Bryan, Ms. Parks is coming to town.
We're going to get together and talk.
Do you want to come over and listen? "And I'd say," Yes, Ma'am, I do. "And she'd say," Well what are you going to do when you get here? "I said," I'm going to listen. "And I'd go over there and I would, I would just listen.
It would be so energizing and so empowering.
And one time I was over there listening to these women talk, and after a couple of hours Ms. Parks turned to me and she said, "Now Bryan, tell me what the Equal Justice Initiative is.
Tell me what you're trying to do. "And I began giving her my rap.
I said, "Well we're trying to challenge injustice.
We're trying to help people who have been wrongly convicted.
We're trying to confront bias and discrimination in the administration of criminal justice.
We're trying to end life without parole sentences for children.
We're trying to do something about the death penalty.
We're trying to reduce the prison population.
We're trying to end mass incarceration. "
I gave her my whole rap, and when I finished she looked at me and she said, "Mmm mmm mmm." She said, "That's going to make you tired, tired, tired." (Laughter) And that's when Ms. Carr leaned forward, she put her finger in my face, she said, "That's why you've got to be brave, brave, brave."
And I actually believe that the TED community needs to be more courageous.
We need to find ways to embrace these challenges, these problems, the suffering.
Because ultimately, our humanity depends on everyone's humanity.
I've learned very simple things doing the work that I do.
It's just taught me very simple things.
I've come to understand and to believe that each of us is more than the worst thing we've ever done.
I believe that for every person on the planet.
I think if somebody tells a lie, they're not just a liar.
I think if somebody takes something that doesn't belong to them, they're not just a thief.
I think even if you kill someone, you're not just a killer.
And because of that there's this basic human dignity that must be respected by law.
I also believe that in many parts of this country, and certainly in many parts of this globe, that the opposite of poverty is not wealth.
I don't believe that.
I actually think, in too many places, the opposite of poverty is justice.
And finally, I believe that, despite the fact that it is so dramatic and so beautiful and so inspiring and so stimulating, we will ultimately not be judged by our technology, we won't be judged by our design, we won't be judged by our intellect and reason.
Ultimately, you judge the character of a society, not by how they treat their rich and the powerful and the privileged, but by how they treat the poor, the condemned, the incarcerated.
Because it's in that nexus that we actually begin to understand truly profound things about who we are.
I sometimes get out of balance.
I'll end with this story.
I sometimes push too hard.
I do get tired, as we all do.
Sometimes those ideas get ahead of our thinking in ways that are important.
And I've been representing these kids who have been sentenced to do these very harsh sentences.
And I go to the jail and I see my client who's 13 and 14, and he's been certified to stand trial as an adult.
I start thinking, well, how did that happen?
How can a judge turn you into something that you're not?
And the judge has certified him as an adult, but I see this kid.
And I was up too late one night and I starting thinking, well gosh, if the judge can turn you into something that you're not, the judge must have magic power.
Yeah, Bryan, the judge has some magic power.
You should ask for some of that.
And because I was up too late, wasn't thinking real straight, I started working on a motion.
And I had a client who was 14 years old, a young, poor black kid.
And I started working on this motion, and the head of the motion was: "Motion to try my poor, 14-year-old black male client like a privileged, white 75-year-old corporate executive."
(Applause)
And I put in my motion that there was prosecutorial misconduct and police misconduct and judicial misconduct.
There was a crazy line in there about how there's no conduct in this county, it's all misconduct.
And the next morning, I woke up and I thought, now did I dream that crazy motion, or did I actually write it?
And to my horror, not only had I written it, but I had sent it to court.
(Applause)
A couple months went by, and I had just forgotten all about it.
And I finally decided, oh gosh, I've got to go to the court and do this crazy case.
And I got into my car and I was feeling really overwhelmed — overwhelmed.
And I got in my car and I went to this courthouse.
And I was thinking, this is going to be so difficult, so painful.
And I finally got out of the car and I started walking up to the courthouse.
And as I was walking up the steps of this courthouse, there was an older black man who was the janitor in this courthouse.
When this man saw me, he came over to me and he said, "Who are you?" I said, "I'm a lawyer." He said, "You're a lawyer?" I said, "Yes, sir." And this man came over to me and he hugged me.
And he whispered in my ear.
He said, "I'm so proud of you." And I have to tell you, it was energizing.
It connected deeply with something in me about identity, about the capacity of every person to contribute to a community, to a perspective that is hopeful.
Well I went into the courtroom.
And as soon as I walked inside, the judge saw me coming in. He said, "Mr. Stevenson, did you write this crazy motion?" I said, "Yes, sir. I did." And we started arguing.
And people started coming in because they were just outraged. I had written these crazy things.
And police officers were coming in and assistant prosecutors and clerk workers.
And before I knew it, the courtroom was filled with people angry that we were talking about race, that we were talking about poverty, that we were talking about inequality.
And out of the corner of my eye, I could see this janitor pacing back and forth.
And he kept looking through the window, and he could hear all of this holler.
He kept pacing back and forth.
And finally, this older black man with this very worried look on his face came into the courtroom and sat down behind me, almost at counsel table.
About 10 minutes later the judge said we would take a break.
And during the break there was a deputy sheriff who was offended that the janitor had come into court.
And this deputy jumped up and he ran over to this older black man.
He said, "Jimmy, what are you doing in this courtroom?" And this older black man stood up and he looked at that deputy and he looked at me and he said, "I came into this courtroom to tell this young man, keep your eyes on the prize, hold on."
I've come to TED because I believe that many of you understand that the moral arc of the universe is long, but it bends toward justice.
That we cannot be full evolved human beings until we care about human rights and basic dignity.
That all of our survival is tied to the survival of everyone.
That our visions of technology and design and entertainment and creativity have to be married with visions of humanity, compassion and justice.
And more than anything, for those of you who share that, I've simply come to tell you to keep your eyes on the prize, hold on.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
Chris Anderson: So you heard and saw an obvious desire by this audience, this community, to help you on your way and to do something on this issue.
Other than writing a check, what could we do?
BS: Well there are opportunities all around us.
If you live in the state of California, for example, there's a referendum coming up this spring where actually there's going to be an effort to redirect some of the money we spend on the politics of punishment.
For example, here in California we're going to spend one billion dollars on the death penalty in the next five years — one billion dollars.
And yet, 46 percent of all homicide cases don't result in arrest.
56 percent of all rape cases don't result.
So there's an opportunity to change that.
And this referendum would propose having those dollars go to law enforcement and safety.
And I think that opportunity exists all around us.
CA: There's been this huge decline in crime in America over the last three decades.
And part of the narrative of that is sometimes that it's about increased incarceration rates.
What would you say to someone who believed that?
BS: Well actually the violent crime rate has remained relatively stable.
The great increase in mass incarceration in this country wasn't really in violent crime categories.
It was this misguided war on drugs.
That's where the dramatic increases have come in our prison population.
And we got carried away with the rhetoric of punishment.
And so we have three strikes laws that put people in prison forever for stealing a bicycle, for low-level property crimes, rather than making them give those resources back to the people who they victimized.
I believe we need to do more to help people who are victimized by crime, not do less.
And I think our current punishment philosophy does nothing for no one.
And I think that's the orientation that we have to change.
(Applause)
CA: Bryan, you've struck a massive chord here.
You're an inspiring person.
Thank you so much for coming to TED. Thank you.
So a couple of years ago I started a program to try to get the rockstar tech and design people to take a year off and work in the one environment that represents pretty much everything they're supposed to hate; we have them work in government.
The program is called Code for America, and it's a little bit like a Peace Corps for geeks.
We select a few fellows every year and we have them work with city governments.
Instead of sending them off into the Third World, we send them into the wilds of City Hall.
And there they make great apps, they work with city staffers.
But really what they're doing is they're showing what's possible with technology today.
So meet Al. Al is a fire hydrant in the city of Boston.
Here it kind of looks like he's looking for a date, but what he's really looking for is for someone to shovel him out when he gets snowed in, because he knows he's not very good at fighting fires when he's covered in four feet of snow.
Now how did he come to be looking for help in this very unique manner?
We had a team of fellows in Boston last year through the Code for America program.
They were there in February, and it snowed a lot in February last year.
And they noticed that the city never gets to digging out these fire hydrants.
But one fellow in particular, a guy named Erik Michaels-Ober, noticed something else, and that's that citizens are shoveling out sidewalks right in front of these things.
So he did what any good developer would do, he wrote an app.
It's a cute little app where you can adopt a fire hydrant.
So you agree to dig it out when it snows.
If you do, you get to name it, and he called the first one Al.
And if you don't, someone can steal it from you.
So it's got cute little game dynamics on it.
This is a modest little app.
It's probably the smallest of the 21 apps that the fellows wrote last year.
But it's doing something that no other government technology does.
It's spreading virally.
There's a guy in the I.T. department of the City of Honolulu who saw this app and realized that he could use it, not for snow, but to get citizens to adopt tsunami sirens.
It's very important that these tsunami sirens work, but people steal the batteries out of them.
So he's getting citizens to check on them.
And then Seattle decided to use it to get citizens to clear out clogged storm drains.
And Chicago just rolled it out to get people to sign up to shovel sidewalks when it snows.
So we now know of nine cities that are planning to use this.
And this has spread just frictionlessly, organically, naturally.
If you know anything about government technology, you know that this isn't how it normally goes.
Procuring software usually takes a couple of years.
We had a team that worked on a project in Boston last year that took three people about two and a half months.
It was a way that parents could figure out which were the right public schools for their kids.
We were told afterward that if that had gone through normal channels, it would have taken at least two years and it would have cost about two million dollars.
And that's nothing.
There is one project in the California court system right now that so far cost taxpayers two billion dollars, and it doesn't work.
And there are projects like this at every level of government.
So an app that takes a couple of days to write and then spreads virally, that's sort of a shot across the bow to the institution of government.
It suggests how government could work better — not more like a private company, as many people think it should.
And not even like a tech company, but more like the Internet itself.
And that means permissionless, it means open, it means generative.
And that's important.
But what's more important about this app is that it represents how a new generation is tackling the problem of government — not as the problem of an ossified institution, but as a problem of collective action.
And that's great news, because, it turns out, we're very good at collective action with digital technology.
Now there's a very large community of people that are building the tools that we need to do things together effectively.
It's not just Code for America fellows, there are hundreds of people all over the country that are standing and writing civic apps every day in their own communities.
They haven't given up on government.
They are frustrated as hell with it, but they're not complaining about it, they're fixing it.
And these folks know something that we've lost sight of.
And that's that when you strip away all your feelings about politics and the line at the DMV and all those other things that we're really mad about, government is, at its core, in the words of Tim O'Reilly, "What we do together that we can't do alone."
Now a lot of people have given up on government.
And if you're one of those people, I would ask that you reconsider, because things are changing.
Politics is not changing; government is changing.
And because government ultimately derives its power from us — remember "We the people?" — how we think about it is going to effect how that change happens.
Now I didn't know very much about government when I started this program.
And like a lot of people, I thought government was basically about getting people elected to office.
Well after two years, I've come to the conclusion that, especially local government, is about opossums.
This is the call center for the services and information line.
It's generally where you will get if you call 311 in your city.
If you should ever have the chance to staff your city's call center, as our fellow Scott Silverman did as part of the program — in fact, they all do that — you will find that people call government with a very wide range of issues, including having an opossum stuck in your house.
So Scott gets this call.
He types "Opossum" into this official knowledge base.
He doesn't really come up with anything.
He starts with animal control.
And finally, he says, "Look, can you just open all the doors to your house and play music really loud and see if the thing leaves?" So that worked. So booya for Scott. But that wasn't the end of the opossums.
Boston doesn't just have a call center.
It has an app, a Web and mobile app, called Citizens Connect.
Now we didn't write this app.
This is the work of the very smart people at the Office of New Urban Mechanics in Boston.
So one day — this is an actual report — this came in: "Opossum in my trashcan.
Can't tell if it's dead.
How do I get this removed? "But what happens with Citizens Connect is different.
So Scott was speaking person-to-person.
But on Citizens Connect everything is public, so everybody can see this.
And in this case, a neighbor saw it.
And the next report we got said, "I walked over to this location, found the trashcan behind the house. Opossum? Check. Living? Yep. Turned trashcan on its side. Walked home. Goodnight sweet opossum."
(Laughter)
Pretty simple. So this is great. This is the digital meeting the physical.
And it's also a great example of government getting in on the crowd-sourcing game.
But it's also a great example of government as a platform.
And I don't mean necessarily a technological definition of platform here.
I'm just talking about a platform for people to help themselves and to help others.
So one citizen helped another citizen, but government played a key role here.
It connected those two people.
And it could have connected them with government services if they'd been needed, but a neighbor is a far better and cheaper alternative to government services.
When one neighbor helps another, we strengthen our communities.
We call animal control, it just costs a lot of money.
Now one of the important things we need to think about government is that it's not the same thing as politics.
And most people get that, but they think that one is the input to the other.
That our input to the system of government is voting.
Now how many times have we elected a political leader — and sometimes we spend a lot of energy getting a new political leader elected — and then we sit back and we expect government to reflect our values and meet our needs, and then not that much changes?
That's because government is like a vast ocean and politics is the six-inch layer on top.
And what's under that is what we call bureaucracy.
And we say that word with such contempt.
But it's that contempt that keeps this thing that we own and we pay for as something that's working against us, this other thing, and then we're disempowering ourselves.
People seem to think politics is sexy.
If we want this institution to work for us, we're going to have to make bureaucracy sexy.
Because that's where the real work of government happens.
We have to engage with the machinery of government.
So that's OccupytheSEC movement has done.
Have you seen these guys?
It's a group of concerned citizens that have written a very detailed 325-page report that's a response to the SEC's request for comment on the Financial Reform Bill.
That's not being politically active, that's being bureaucratically active.
Now for those of us who've given up on government, it's time that we asked ourselves about the world that we want to leave for our children.
You have to see the enormous challenges that they're going to face.
Do we really think we're going to get where we need to go without fixing the one institution that can act on behalf of all of us?
We can't do without government, but we do need it to be more effective.
The good news is that technology is making it possible to fundamentally reframe the function of government in a way that can actually scale by strengthening civil society.
And there's a generation out there that's grown up on the Internet, and they know that it's not that hard to do things together, you just have to architect the systems the right way.
Now the average age of our fellows is 28, so I am, begrudgingly, almost a generation older than most of them.
This is a generation that's grown up taking their voices pretty much for granted.
They're not fighting that battle that we're all fighting about who gets to speak; they all get to speak.
They can express their opinion on any channel at any time, and they do.
So when they're faced with the problem of government, they don't care as much about using their voices.
They're using their hands.
They're using their hands to write applications that make government work better.
And those applications let us use our hands to make our communities better.
That could be shoveling out a hydrant, pulling a weed, turning over a garbage can with an opossum in it.
And certainly, we could have been shoveling out those fire hydrants all along, and many people do.
But these apps are like little digital reminders that we're not just consumers, and we're not just consumers of government, putting in our taxes and getting back services.
We're more than that, we're citizens.
And we're not going to fix government until we fix citizenship.
So the question I have for all of you here: When it comes to the big, important things that we need to do together, all of us together, are we just going to be a crowd of voices, or are we also going to be a crowd of hands?
Thank you.
(Applause)
This may sound strange, but I'm a big fan of the concrete block.
The first concrete blocks were manufactured in 1868 with a very simple idea: modules made of cement of a fixed measurement that fit together.
Very quickly concrete blocks became the most-used construction unit in the world.
They enabled us to to build things that were larger than us, buildings, bridges, one brick at a time.
Essentially concrete blocks had become the building block of our time.
Almost a hundred years later in 1947, LEGO came up with this.
It was called the Automatic Binding Brick.
And in a few short years, LEGO bricks took place in every household.
It's estimated that over 400 billion bricks have been produced — or 75 bricks for every person on the planet.
You don't have to be an engineer to make beautiful houses, beautiful bridges, beautiful buildings.
LEGO made it accessible.
LEGO has essentially taken the concrete block, the building block of the world, and made it into the building block of our imagination.
Meanwhile the exact same year, at Bell Labs the next revolution was about to be announced, the next building block.
The transistor was a small plastic unit that would take us from a world of static bricks piled on top of each other to a world where everything was interactive.
Like the concrete block, the transistor allows you to build much larger, more complex circuits, one brick at a time.
But there's a main difference: The transistor was only for experts.
I personally don't accept this, that the building block of our time is reserved for experts, so I decided to change that.
Eight years ago when I was at the Media Lab, I started exploring this idea of how to put the power of engineers in the hands of artists and designers.
A few years ago I started developing littleBits.
Let me show you how they work.
LittleBits are electronic modules with each one specific function.
They're pre-engineered to be light, sound, motors and sensors.
And the best part about it is they snap together with magnets.
So you can't put them the wrong way.
The bricks are color-coded.
Green is output, blue is power, pink is input and orange is wire.
So all you need to do is snap a blue to a green and very quickly you can start making larger circuits.
You put a blue to a green, you can make light.
You can put a knob in between and now you've made a little dimmer.
Switch out the knob for a pulse module, which is here, and now you've made a little blinker.
Add this buzzer for some extra punch and you've created a noise machine.
I'm going to stop that.
So beyond simple play, littleBits are actually pretty powerful.
Instead of having to program, to wire, to solder, littleBits allow you to program using very simple intuitive gestures.
So to make this blink faster or slower, you would just turn this knob and basically make it pulse faster or slower.
The idea behind littleBits is that it's a growing library.
We want to make every single interaction in the world into a ready-to-use brick.
Lights, sounds, solar panels, motors — everything should be accessible.
We've been giving littleBits to kids and seeing them play with them.
And it's been an incredible experience.
The nicest thing is how they start to understand the electronics around them from everyday that they don't learn at schools.
For example, how a nightlight works, or why an elevator door stays open, or how an iPod responds to touch.
We've also been taking littleBits to design schools.
So for example, we've had designers with no experience with electronics whatsoever start to play with littleBits as a material.
Here you see, with felt and paper water bottles, we have Geordie making...
(Clanging)
(Buzzing)
A few weeks ago we took littleBits to RISD and gave them to some designers with no experience in engineering whatsoever — just cardboard, wood and paper — and told them "Make something." Here's an example of a project they made, a motion-activated confetti canon ball. (Laughter) But wait, this is actually my favorite project.
It's a lobster made of playdough that's afraid of the dark.
(Laughter)
To these non-engineers, littleBits became another material, electronics became just another material.
And we want to make this material accessible to everyone.
So littleBits is open-source.
You can go on the website, download all the design files, make them yourself.
We want to encourage a world of creators, of inventors, of contributors, because this world that we live in, this interactive world, is ours.
So go ahead and start inventing.
Thank you.
(Applause)
