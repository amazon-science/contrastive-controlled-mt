It doesnt roll off the tongue at all lol its ridiculous,  you cant even say it fast.

Yeah that is so lame to me. If you don't like it, then you learn your lesson and don't buy any more tickets to any more concerts.

What did you think of the last couple elections?
No worries.   Perhaps Eddie Van Halen is more your speed?  He played on "Beat It!"

you know that, parents are just so important like everything you are doing in life and just gone, especially my father will be crazy
So, they're not all, so, what I meant by on the same level or on a different level is not necessarily how yours was done up. I know your company divides the students into levels.

so that is that you learned from the family already so these are definitely a lot of stuff that I learned values that I learned
You exercise at work. A likely excuse. In your life, did you ever get, was there ever a point where you were exercising routinely?
You own your personality that shapes who you are and there's just no guarantee, there's just no textbook that can teach you all these things for sure.
Oh, my God, what's wrong with you, are the only person ever who said that.
