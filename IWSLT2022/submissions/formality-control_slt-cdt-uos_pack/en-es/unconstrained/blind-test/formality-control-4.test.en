Wow, that's awesome! Who is your favorite Baseball team? I like my Az team lol
You would think that would have been written about a long time ago. Switching gears ... id you know that Apple had a clothing line in 1986?
Yeah, I found that out a few years ago, there is so much ocean that hasn't been explored. Can you imagine what is in there?
I think that in a foxhole,your motivation to succeed would be pretty high. Try that and see what happens. LOL
Leonard Nimoy played a role in that tv show.  Nice chatting with you too!
So, Did you even realize that Comedy Central has cancelled over 100 shows since 1989??
Yeah it would be. No, I don't really have a favorite, how about yourself?
I'll be joining you!  Crocodiles are more closely related to birds than they are to snakes and lizards.  Odd fact.

Me too, what do you think about Fox news? Apparently they are watched more than msnbc and cnn combined.
You would still have rights in Germany though, no matter what holdovers from your ancestors.  Under the 1912 Scottish Protection of Animals Act, the Loch Ness monster is a protected species.

That sounds pretty cool. I would do it, would you?

I skim it, and look for key phrases like, "Give u your soul" and "Organ harvesting" etc. :)
Hi, I love Disney movies!  I think Disney in general is great.  When you think about it being founded back in 1923 and it is still going strong, it's amazing.
lol, I agree with you!! I didn't know Nevada is the only state to have a none of the above voting option?
have you seen guardians of the galaxy?
I think thats a good idea, afterall you have to listen to your people, you know the like button is actually ilegal in a town of Germany!
Yeah I agree that is surprising for sure. Sounds like she had some star studded classmates at the dragon school too! Well it was really nice getting the chance to talk with you!
That's insane. I just learned they have Wizard of Oz inspired shoes that can guide you home when you click you heels
Speaking of dancing, are you aware that Michael Jackson holds a patent on a dance device?
I have to say House of Cards or Better Call Saul, what about yours?

Yes, your height is great for corner kicks. maybe as a goalie too. Anyway, great chat!
Yes I do. My favorite superhero is Batman.Who is your favorite superhero?
It doesnt roll off the tongue at all lol its ridiculous,  you cant even say it fast.

Yah, it's quite a bit larger than a baseball for sure, I've never seen a softball video game though, have you?
Have you ever seen Big hero 6?
True.   Then again, if you are recording on a houseboat like Pink Floyd, it doesn't much matter if your ship is going down!
Mackinac Island may not be for your gnome then. They have no cars, which is inconvenient for lazy gnomes!
I have never heard that fact, very odd. Do you use an iphone yourself?

Any object! So yes lol....must have been interesting!! As funny as if you grunt...before a shot...it is by some considered to be cheating!
That is kind of cool. Speaking of cool, do you think Ugg boots are cool? They were invented by surfers to keep their feet warm after getting out of the water.
I guess New Zealand would be ideal for you, with no snakes and all
I wonder what that entails. Speaking of aggressive, you can legally equip your car with flamethrowers in South Africa to prevent carjacking. Crazy!
Who was your favorite nemesis in Superman? I loved lex luther
Hi there. Do you like to play video games?
Ha, maybe you should. Officials in Athens didn't have much faith in elections. They thought it would lead to oligarchy.
Yes, I wouldn't be able to function without a car. I don't live close to anything and have to drive everywhere. How about yourself.
That's really nice of him! What a nice guy, why do you think Greenland can't join FIFA? Apparently it's because they can't grow green grass LOL

I do. Do you like her music?
Yes, i hear your words! Oh, wait. youre not a robot are you?
it is vague to me but i sort of recall reading it.  and of course "breakfast of champions."  going back to your remark about the fda burning tons of literature, yes it is depressing.
Yeah me neither, what did you think about Katy Perry and her wings?
Yeah, Hey listen to this it's illegal in south africa to equip a flame-thrower to your car to prevent carjacking.
he had notoriety to launch a campaign. if you are rich, famous, tall, etc you can run for govt. i figure the future is all about marketing, not content.
It is really nice of him. What do you think about Glenn Howerton? He actually was the star of Always Sunny in Philadelphia and he almost got the lead in Jurassic World
Hi! So do you like music? I love rock music and well many other genre's.
ya I do think they have a lot of power at present, I don't know that I want them expanding out much further, they control a lot of information, do you do any reading in your spare time?
That is intriguing. Edgar Allen Poe wrote the oldest known example of a cyborg in fiction. Did you hear that?
Dark Knight also.  I think Christian Bale is my favorite Batman.  Who's your favorite?
Haha that is super creative. Do you ever read movie reviews?
That was good. I heard of him. On another topic, do you use your cell phone a lot?
Those pucks look dangerous flying around.  I understand that most other countries understand hockey to mean field hockey.  I guess it depend on if your country is cold or not.
No. I hate snakes. I mean irrational hate! Do you?
Yep, the key is doing things that you can incorporate into a life long habit. DOn't compare your progress to others.
I enjoyed chatting with you as well! And yes I'll go to local pet store and see if they have elephants in stock haha
I love the original 3 like you. But the new ones are bad, I agree.
ha nope not at all, would you ever upload your brain to a usb drive if you could?
That is an awesome collection, I hope there is not Taylor Swift in there, that would ruin the collection! What are your best ones?
I do too, I don't particularly like him. Did you vote last election
What do you think about the United Nations appointing an ambassador to extraterrestrials? I wonder what he does all day, sounds like the most boring job in the world because obviously we haven't had contact yet
That guy was everywhere. Did you ever watch wall-e?
I will, I now have to look both up and down! Enjoy your day!
It seems that way. I've heard that it's illegal to "own" pets in Boulder, Colorado, but you can be their "guardian." Does that mean you can claim them on your taxes?
That is an honor. Would Miami be your team being from Florida? They had some glory years not that long ago.
Where do you source your news? Fox, Cnn, other?
No I do think that's true on another movies note, why did you think of Jurassic world Fallen Kingdom? I thought it was horrible
Wow, did you ever try any of the baseball games on playstation?
That's true, too! Well, nice chatting with you, enjoy your day.
yes, you want to connect to the operator so they can hear you gasping your last breaths. LOL.
I'm fine.  Thanks for asking and you?
Well, you can search up yourself and you can probably find your Facebook account or something.
That is too bad. DO you like Drake?
Hey there I love horses. Even though I'm allergic to them they are still very fun to ride, what do you think
you get to wear panda costumes while working with them!
I use to live near Lake Michigan. I have been to both oceans and the Gulf of Mexico. I don't know if my Ugg boots would go well with my Hawaiian shirt. What do you think?
That is pretty cool - sort of like the pokemon app on your phone!
lol you kind of need that for your job lol! I couldn't live without it. How would I know interesting facts?
I haven't seen it, but I'll take your word for it.
If you got it why not? He is worth over 20 billion dollars after all.
I find it sad that this was not done until 2013. Don't you think it should have been earlier than that?
hmm that seems dumb like its just playing with words, do you like Teddy Roosevelt? apparently he had over 20 pets, or as they say in Colorado, "Guardians" haha
Yeah I haven't seen those movies but I heard they were just awful. Another hilariously bad movie is called Rubber, it's a horror movie. Have you seen or heard of it? It deserves a Razzie for sure.
Yep I agree it seems stupid. I don't know why they need to play on grass specifically, did you hear about the longest tennis point of all time?
Yeah I get your point, well there is a website for low budget travelers, it great if you dont mind sleeping on a couch,
What is your favorite thing about Amazon? Mine is the shopping site, I can pretty much find anything!
yikes, I don't think that name would go over so well in the USA lol. It was so nice chatting with you, enjoy your day!
Yes! That is it, but it seemed like you were on a crazy ride lol. That franchise is worth 3 billion dollars that's pretty amazing for older movies.
i never realized how good dogs were at knowing what pointing is. but if you point, a dog will follow your finger. its great
Thank goodness, indeed. I agree with you, though, there is still progress to be made, and I think reading diverse fiction and poetry can help people see things from other perspectives.
I used to play video games. Not much now. Lost interest. Do you?
Do you collect anything? I like to collect hats.
yes, but in bad neighborhoods sometimes people break into your place and you might need to confront them. you want your shoes on then. clothing would be good too.
Are you interested in dogs? They are quite clever. Dogs can learn over a thousand words and reason better than chimps.
The Republican Party is really popular in the states do you agree?
Can you imagine looking out your hotel window in Las Vegas and seeing that 50ft robot roaming around!! ha, ha ha!!
Good morning. Just wondering, would you consider lots of healthy eating as being part of your perfect day?
Intriguing. Did you hear about the judge in Michigan who delivered a ruling againt him? She delivered it by rapping when she ruled.
That is insane! Oh judge Judy wonder what you do with all your money lol. Anyways, it's been good talking, I hope you have a good night!
No but Im sure they are doing just fine without your revenue. Silence of the Lamb came out on valentines day? Seems odd.
Enjoy it, I will have to check the news out to see it. Enjoy your weekend also!
What do you think of Serena Williams?
Someone stole your gnome? Who steals a gnome? Was it the travelocity gnome looking for a friend?
I think he is a great actor. Well, nice chatting with you!
Probably a lot more than 55,000. Ha! Did you ever see Wall-E? If so, the name is actually a tip of the hat to Walter Elias Disney himself!
Hey how is it going, you ever cook a turkey during Thanksgiving?
Yeah you would think drinking salty water through your mouth would taste bad lol
Yeah me too. On another topics, do you have much interest in science?
That would be scary. When you turn 100 in Japan, the PM sends you a silver cup to celebrate.
Interesting! What kind of dogs do you like?
I am well. I used to play video games but gave them up when I got married. Do you??
I agree, It was nice chatting with you as well. Have a great day!
Lets talk about Children's Literature next. The government in Norway will buy 1000 copies of your book that you publish in Norway to distribute to libraries, 1500 if its a children's book.
Wow, that is a long time to take to write a script. Well, nice chatting with you!
You too! Have a good night! Enjoy your nintendo!
I think the republicans will win. Do you think someone will run against Trump on the republican ballot next time?
I'm doing well today, how about yourself?
Oh wow, definitely not! Anyways, I am going to get going, great chatting with you, take care and have a great night!
I think the movie tried to have an overall good message to be the best you can be in everything you do. Inspirational for many.
Also amazing, i love those shows about ocean life, theres a whole way of life down there, do you ever watch Blue Planet? Whats your favorite water animal? I love Orcas and Octopus
I would do exactly the same as you. How could you not pass that up the chance to set yourself up for life? lol
Yes they do!  have you watched any movies created by Disney?  Bill Nye was a science consultant for the movie Flubber.
i agree with you. it happened several years ago. it says pro-trumpers found them and posted them to social media. that seems odd...
I read them sometimes, I mostly rely on Rotten Tomatoes, and you?
I think I would have to say Marvel, I grew up watching shows and reading those comics. How about yourself?
You sound like me! I have been to so many concerts and have bought so much music over the years. I have  alot to refer back to. Do you have favorite bands?
Yeah. In Kentucky, you can't take office if you've ever participated in a duel. Maybe that's what we need more of in politics today -- duels.
Sorry I didn't see your question about fish, btw. I've tried to keep goldfish as pets several times over the years. I had a pet corn snake once too. How big was your python?
Yeah and also, many people don't know there's really no correlation between connection quality and service bars either. To answer your question, I'm not sure. What does Minnie Mouse stand for?
I think I have read that before as well, I think it would be so wild to see your manager take an at bat!
Well, its time to start cycling to work. Nice chatting with you.
I didn't know that, would you call that a "copy cat?" haha
Do you like Legos? did you ever play with them as a child or even later?
I don't know what you mean? There is a group called transhumanist's that want to upload their minds to computers and memory sticks!
Yeah, when you put it that way the least of your worries is your phone getting damaged but getting hit on the head and suffering from a brain injury.
I am with you there, what is your favorite movie?
What can't dogs do! I know they aren't color blind like we were taught when young. It was so nice chatting with you, tell yuki hi!
you're walking through the building, you're going slowly with your big bag. It was like get the fuck out of the way. It's not a hotel
Got it. Any of your family members ever done something to put like you're on the famous.
Just thought he would be born with like just your family.
Because I know in California, they passed a bill saying If you wanna opt out of companies taking their tax, your tax your data, you can do that.
I don't know if your phone backs up automatically or if (you've lost) if you don't have enough memory, but that seems like that would be really important.
If you can just get yourself incarcerated maybe everything would work out.
you understand.
my boyfriend Sam has a message saved somewhere like the message that was going to your room.
because we knew that they weren't gonna continue to buy if they are going to but it seems that the Amazon made it possible like they can give you just like print out the label
well, all should be like in your paperwork, what times that they can contact you, what to do
Then you can put in your pocket and use when you want to flip it out, it's a full screen.
How was your day?
No, so is your friend staying there permanently, where do the children staying and how is her relationship with their husband and how are things there because of work or is he closer to his family.
you tell me yours and I will get back to you on that.
and you're gonna wanna get rid of it anyway and it's just gonna go to the goodwill or to a buffalo exchange if they'll take it and it's not everything is meant to just be replaced
I would certainly never buy it for myself. I like some of the doughnuts that we had that are like dough. What's that place that we used to go on your way to work?
your car now I know it sounds callous but as I said sometimes I think that is a more favourable option anyway.
you never know what you could take from another culture and incorporate into your own and make it better.
your plans for the future like what type you are generally speaking?
I can accommodate your agenda, but it's always just like a problem like for example when I first met Joseph
you know what I am saying get off me
you can add more friendly and new members in just throught that
The phone, I think, things that are going to be able to do things. You know, like, let's use your eyes to, like, have the page go down and stuff like that.
But it's also hard to see when your friend isn't happy
What are your favorite road trips that you've ever taken?
Now you, where do you work currently? A pizzeria. Is this what you, this isn't your career though?
I just see how I can be without a degree. there are so many jobs you can't enable yourself into new jobs anymore.
Ok, so for your career though, I think you're gonna have to look more professional. Is that something you've thought about at all?
Now they are your family members I don't know what word to use here.
So you feel like he told you, so his father must have been born.
Can I have your phone number from which you called us previously?
think of your iPhone, if you could just fold your iPhone in half.
Yeah. What about yourself? What do you do?
what's yours like?
So you've got to work a nice balance in between
You know they start off young. They start off when you young, you know what I mean. Take you to the basketball. Go play basketball, football
Ok, so how has telecom improved your life?
you could get GoogleTV which I have now, it's like fifty dollars a month and you can get channels, so you get everything to get the history channel, but you get
you close the account and you can do that online, you can give the cause and then closing my account tomorrow and my my sister's
Excuse me. Does your job require a uniform?
That sounds like that makes a lot of sense, your next step.
now mom's always looking out, she always looks out you know what I am saying, I give her money all the time
I mean it's a little weird, you are working on the weekend, so it's like you know
I said from the grapevine what I heard your family isn't as large but you know there is nothing wrong with that
close by who is diverting your attention.
a stranger off the street like your average Joe, you know, like they could be, it's too different. I mean people will throw people off.
do your own thing, which was awesome and it was a great place to be. I don't know if you have any location that struck? You guys are international travel.
Yeah. How about your childhood friends from your community that you grew up with?
and I was like, hey do you want to get something off the menu and your looking at the menu. And it took us a while to decide anyway. So we get a beer
you know that you gotta go to school for that, you know what I am saying.
So, okay, lemme see, lemme test your age and see if I can guess. I think you're about my age. How was the, how do you, what's the oldest way you remember to get the prizes?
if you are gonna get diner food, like Denny's is not gonna be your best culinary option.
I'm pretty good, I had a very interesting morning. I'll tell you about it while you handle your texts and stuff.
Oh that's awesome but girl let me tell you, so it sounds like Amber girl you guys have everything set for your beautiful, tranquil, loving, romantic
Yeah, like even HBO you can get through crime.
You can't type anything in yours, but with our program, we can select pre-determined comments. So, you can say that the child was distracted, you can say they were off task,
Oh yeah, I do and I think and my husband does too. Have you ever seen a shrimp that's the size of your palm? There are some really big shrimp here in Florida
Now, it's easier to get your money back, but back then it was a whole big thing and you know
You don't really know exactly where it's coming from and so it's tough to put all your faith in that.
watched show and all that, she watched videos, people you know what I am saying?
Oh, on each side, that's crazy if you got ten on this side, ten on that side, is it mostly boys, there are girls
What did your friend think about all this? Are you an adventurous spirit? He just goes along and seemed to enjoy it or what?
I might sound strange, but I feel like people buy less electronics these days because everything has been condensed. Like, my phone, your cellphone, is like ten things
all the time values that you learned from your family.
you know that, parents are just so important like everything you are doing in life and just gone, especially my father will be crazy
talk to your friends about stuff like this I don't know you don't want to
I think every other way other than that is a worse way. If someone said hey your family is going through a little bit of a crisis okay, don't worry it's nothing that they, it happens to everyone
Okay. The first topic is my favorite movie. What's your favorite movie?
Yeah, that's Walmart that's way better, you can get all of these things in Walmart
I just want them to do them. You know what I mean.
after going out saying you've got to go to school,
No, I mean, and there are definitely steps to cooking it, like what your mom did, the rice and then add the milk and all.
your mother and your sister go with you on the the skiing trip?
So what is your secret, your favourite secret show, like a show that you love that you wouldn't, that people wouldn't think that you like?
Maybe you're going to some kind of event or restaurant. When you're doing something like that, how much thought do you put into your outfit?
So what is your profession? How would you describe that?
Or head over to the mall and just spend your worries away. And then look at the state's credit card statement in a month and get more worried.
I don't need your advice, I just need your cash.
it doesn't stop, it just grows, everything grows, you know what I am saying
I mean I do once in a while if there is something specific l am looking for, you know a good piece of fish or something or that I know that's not frozen
Not in your mouth. Don't put that in your mouth. Don't put that in your mouth!
where is your family originally come from where do you guys are if you point on a map
Wow, today you could play with them so they could meet them too
Doing better, of course, the other thing is the whole tax situation, which is the return for an independent contractor so you know, or you have to be responsible for paying your taxes quarterly and you know?
I think even your PayPal email address.
It's okay I mean, he said he's going to pay via PayPal and can you just text me your PayPal?
it's not in your control you are born into it which is what I was asking you that question earlier of which family would you be in
I actually read a book or, imagine, I read a book on your love language and learning it, your attachment styles and stuff with your partner
what do I like about my work? what you like about your makeup and about doing makeup?
I'll violate and whatever because people, it's none of your business. What if I'm babysitting?
Okay. So the end goal is your gonna become a mental health counsellor. And you prefer to work with adults with mental health issues. And substance abuse issues, excuse me.
family is just crazy, you got a lot of cousins,
and also just in your life. What are your favorite movies?
And in your city of kids that are looking ,
I cannot believe it. You know honestly, I could see how this is like, for people who need to or if you are a professional talker like you would
the same as recycling styrofoam,it's like you have to put them into landfill and it stays there forever, and unwanted clothing now is like all-time high
So you worked out yourself naturally. Okay, that's great.
Can I add the charge to your card that's in your account for the payment?
Yeah, you can just get rid of it, I mean cut your cost.
there's no magic science, I choose this store because of that, what are your needs? Okay.
Doing great. So, I have not caught up with you in a long time. Tell me about this trip that you took with this guy. What? How was your trip over in Asia?
We don't think you should go if you can't find your wallet and I was like, no, I can find it. So I got it and then we went downtown
Yeah, it was nice to be out somewhere warm. I thought you said that you and your sister got
So, they're not all, so, what I meant by on the same level or on a different level is not necessarily how yours was done up. I know your company divides the students into levels.
and the stuff that I learned from my parents and my family in general and just use it to enhance my kids' experience. It's all about making their experience better than yours.
now I understand you. Interesting point of view. that's an awesome story. I didn't know that. that's pretty cool from your travels.
he can pick your family but you can pick your friends as I say which has always been an interesting dynamic and I neither I mentioned this briefly
Are you real, are you really strict with your kids are you go back to discipline.
Since we are cousins and we are a small family I know about your cousin in Longmont now.
we were with each other for only a couple of months and I moved to a different town and I was like, hey, I'm booking your trip to Asia, you want to come with me?
you see, I told you not get yourself too busy.
you learned a lot of stuff for your family I will be responsible
we were doing I don't know something talking about emotions or whatever acting school and Cathleen was like how did was like when was you and your boyfriend's first kiss and I was like
So when I told him about it, he told me about that. And they said I said that is a little insane. somebody brush your teeth.
So I'll just continue with these tourist artefacts, basically, that's what it was. So there are small booths size of your bathroom, you know single bathroom every single booth has the same thing.
