Haha well they call it soccer-baseball, a very dumb name in my opinion LOL
Same with me.  I must have been 11 or so.  Nintendo is valued at over $85 billion
I've never heard that. Those types of coincidences are always interesting to me.
Yeah, soon amazon will own everything and we will all work at amazon. 15 miles a day. can i do that at my age? LOL
Yeah. I just had my son next to me at my desk doing math homework. I hope I set a good example, at least...
Exactly. That's why I watch both CNN and Fox. It kind of helps me to sort through the muck.
Have you ever player Hockey?  I'm not good on skates so it never tempted me, I'd be dangerous with a hockey stick in my hand.
I dont I have about 6 paris myself, I bet ballet dancers do
Yeah me too! I love Frozen though.
Really, me either. I have a bad memory for some things. lol, but I think I will never forget that Minnie Mouse's name is really Minerva.
Wow that is crazy that's a lot of calories to burn in a day! I'm just glad that Amazon has an exclusive contract with USPS to deliver on Sundays, that makes me happy
Yeah! No Bruno's band is called the hooligans. You think since he writes his own music he could have come up with a better name but maybe it's just me.
me too I love dogs so much. Elephants and dogs are the only animals that respond to pointing
Well let me get back to my facebook account and see who posted what.
That is crazy! my computer has a lot more juice than that, unbelievable how tech advances.
Probably fighting unfortunately. Doesn't sound very fun. What is fun is my old NES. I recently busted it out and the thing still works!
I have dogs and used to have cats too but dogs are my favorite.
That is so funny I guess I never considered a seahorse a fish. The black swallower fish sounds a lot like a snake because it can eat pray that is so large.
i have no idea. millions? you got me. some tech billionaire will want the thing and pay a ton.
I like some of their stuff. A few things are a bit underhandedly political for my taste but most is good. You?
Yes, I love it just because it reminds me of my childhood. That is how we lived in that time. Lots of imagination and kids taking off in groups having adventures.
Yes, so delightful and treasured. Mine will mimic things that make me run looking for alarms sometimes.lol
Nice I enjoy watching the world series, my favorite team is the Red Sox, they won it this year!
I bet. i was never interested myself. seemed very violent.
Yes, my animals have those patches. I think it's all the head pats.
That is amazing, 2430 games every year that is just too many numbers for me
They really love their pets huh? No, I don't have any pets. Do you?
Without looking it up, my guess is that Qatar is building a city to host it. Which would be pretty amazing. How about Wonder Woman? Did  you see it? What did you think?
Aha!  I was just racking my brain about EM in that movie!  And now I need to figure out who his wife is!!!
Maybe she's just really small and wanted to seem bigger and more powerfull than she really is. As a 6'6" male, fashion does not come in my size so I don't even worry about it.
Yes they basically made my whole childhood
Yeah, I play a little bit when I was a child but it was not for me, my fingers are short lol.
Oh really, have you heard of the arrow shirt collar? Those were my favorite shirts in my teens.
We had met each other a few times before our actual first date, but my husband took me to go snowboarding and an all you can eat sushi place, I love sushi!
that show wasn't my cup of tea, but I enjoy him when hes on Shark Tank
That sounds like drowning to me! I like that Cornell University makes students pass a basic swim test.  Imagine being best in class and then failing because you can't swim.
LOL I like the way you think. it is crazy though that Amazon owns imdb.com, I use that almost everyday for my movie collection
I like my older Android as well. The prices are too high for me. It has been great chatting!!! Have a great night!! :)
That's pretty crazy. I guess now that I think about it, no other fish do have necks! The oldest goldfish lived until 43. I think mine lived a year.
I think my first nintendon was in mid 80s
that must have taken him quite a while. 224 words, backwards and forwards? my head hurts.
I use it only to make my grocery list! What voice do you use for yours?
im sure, i got my cable disconnected and subscribed to both nextflix and Hulu
that would make sense to me. i guess they need a speedy link to send and receive data. do you believe in extraterrestrials?
You have a good poino video games now (toars Patagonia, so I'm not too worried.
I will have to, yes, his name is rocky, he is my favorite pet of all time, what is your dogs name?
Yeah, I don't remember that at all. He definitely doesn't seem like the type.
I know they need to apply those genes to me! also weird is there is no fish except for the seahorse that has an actual neck
ah yup, all my friends have iphones, but my brother and I are the holdouts with android, theyre just way better with more customizations imo
Yeah, my kids are always watching some Disney movie.  My daughter loves the live action Beauty and the Beast.
Yeah, me too. I like baseball a lot, I played when I was younger.
Not bad.  I see hockey on my list but not that story.  A hockey players was traded for only 1 dollar in 1993 and went on to win 4 stanley cups.  I don't know his name though.
I can believe that. My son watches movies all the time along with TV shows and Netflick originals. He got me hooked on Stranger Things.
It seems a stretch to call it a WWI movie, in  my opinion. I would think a WWI movie would show more soldiers in battle rather than a fictitious superhero movie.
Very smart... hada step son that i tried to implement that on... but his mother never supported me... he would sometimes play for 18 hours straight!
That seems very odd to me. Thinking back to the Sonic games they do not have music that I would have thought a high profile musician made.
Some of my friends say their bill is like $20 per month or less!  I live in an apartment.  yeah thats insanely huge!
I think it's fun to read sometimes. The origins are more interesting for me. Early poems in the Eurasian content evolved from folksongs.
I prefer the original 3 from my childhood in the 70's. Hopefully they learn something from their flops like Treasure planet, not that was a waste of money.
Exactly, well said! I don't want to see grown men spitting water on my 70 inch tv, yuck! That isn't even comedy to me. Its just poor taste and manners.
Yeah, but my guppies are a pain in the neck sometimes...but so am I. But at least I, like most humans, can regrow a surgically-removed rib in about 2-3 months. So, I got that going for me!
I know, really? How about our hiccups are from gills and lungs?
Snakes too, it reminds me of that movie a few years back, Snakes on a Plane.  Maybe I could take my service elephant on my next flight.
I would like to know his secret! Maybe not immortal but give me until 125...
Okay you've got me there, who's Eeyore.
i wish i had. those guys were always touring. i missed my chance.
Oh really? What an awesome fact! I know that when I was a baby, I would spontaneously dance (that's what my parents said). It's crazy how natural dancing is!
Yes, he cracks me up! I like that he refuses to play bad guys in the movies he chooses.
Can you relax with your shoes? John Candy couldn't. he had to take them off. boy his dogs were barking! I usually wear shoes myself.
Absolutely not. News is often depressing, and I could stand without it. Now, toss on a piano song, or music....now you've got me. Though I hate classical music. Well, most of it.
Yes! my older daughter introduced me to them, they are obsessed with K pop and BTS (a boy band in case u havent heard) their songs are catchy
oh yeah? I remember my parents getting pong... LOL
Nice! Stanford's free artificial intelligence class uses Google plus hangouts to help them teach more effectively. What do you think of AI? It kind of scares me. lol
Was it a sheep? I heard the first cloned pet was a cat, though. Its name was copy cat. That is funny!
Hey there my friend do you ever wear shoes.
News to me!  If it gets made into a film, I hope it does not flop at the box office like Disney's Treasure Planet!
Oh yeah I guess so ha ha. There's even a town in Alaska that has a mayor cat.
oh good for them :) my daughter when she was like 1, she was always falling asleep to Metallica ;) it was her lullaby :)
Noway, I was hugging something at 2 months and it wasn't a racket. That is crazy! It reminds me of a Katy Perry song.
Have you heard of these transhumanists who want to load themselves on to memory sticks? My kids keep taking my sticks, I'd hate to be overwritten by some school project.
me either! Nintendo released a handheld console specifically for pokemon in 2001.
that's the other reason that I need the immortal jellyfish genes inside me, so I can eat my weight in pizza everyday and not die prematurely haha
Yeah you would think it's been a lot longer than that. At least to my relocation.
No he wasn't. I like Salvador Dali a lot though he was born on my birthday haha. Have you ever seen a"Hidden Mickey"in any of the movies, I guess there's a subculture that looks for those in the movies
I agree. Seems odd that Cruise, who has won a Golden Globe Award, never won an Oscar for best actor. He's starred in so many films!
I wonder if they had met what he would have written about her.
I use mine somewhat, but not like some people I know. Interesting smoking near apple computers voids the warranty by making it a biohazard!
Neither did I. That is insane because Tupac was a famous rapper.
I am allergic to shellfish...maybe that is it. But can you believe this... I named my son Fisher. So there is a little love there!
She does have dragons, she's just indestructible which I find kind of silly haha. But I know that's just me. It's interesting that the person that plays the mountain is only 25 years old! He definitely looks a lot older
Oh sure, I guess Bender from futurama and the terminator both have the same cpu.
No, but we have a big distribution center in my city and I have been there. Can you believe Jeff Bezos built a clock into a mountain that should run for 10,000 years?
Too fast for me. Do you like rap ? I love Tupac
Based on my knowledge, I know that he sings with a sparkling outfit with a nice grand piano.
That kind of sounds a little bit insane to me to ber honest.
Well said! I think it suits me well too haha. That is where the conical party hat was derived from!
I don't even know the rules for soccer.  It's all the same.  My 12 year old son used to routinely beat me at everything.
I think they are a very good company also. Their animation keeps me pretty entertained.
I remember wanting the trendier clothes my friends wore, and once or twice getting made fun of for wearing hand me downs.
Impressive! Frozen was a very good movie in my opinion.
Yeah. In Kentucky, you can't take office if you've ever participated in a duel. Maybe that's what we need more of in politics today -- duels.
Hi, I love Disney movies!  I think Disney in general is great.  When you think about it being founded back in 1923 and it is still going strong, it's amazing.
Ah cool!  You should go more often then lol Did you see the most recent Beauty and the Beast?
Hey there I love horses. Even though I'm allergic to them they are still very fun to ride, what do you think
I know what you mean. It is the only object known to have life and we need to know why that is.
Who was your favorite nemesis in Superman? I loved lex luther
I guess so! What is your favorite kind of drama, is tv shows? I also think plays are pretty good too!
Did you watch the movie? Was it really a space movie?
Yeah, when you put it that way the least of your worries is your phone getting damaged but getting hit on the head and suffering from a brain injury.
That was good. Nice chatting with you!
I love watching it, which is your favorite team?
I think my favorite album is Bryce Vine. How about yourself?
when the earth was first formed a day was only 5.5 hours long. It was nice chatting with you, have a good night.
On a different note, have you ever heard of K pop?
That is correct! produced by Walt Disney Animated Studios and released by Walt Disney Pictures. It was so cute! They also remade Rapunzel as Tangled, have you seen that?
Yep I can see that perspective. I always thought that it was always red and blue but apparently that started in the year 2000. What were your thoughts on Harry Truman?
Just a random note, did you realize that Bruce Lee wa such a good dancer?
Where do you source your news? Fox, Cnn, other?
What? the drive thru? what exactly was going on at that high school of yours? Respect the drive thru! it was made for the troops!
Yes, I will wait for Elon to travel on it first though before I go. Talk to you soon!
I agree. What are your thoughts on people voicing their religious or political opinions if they don't know what yours are?
Another great idea! You could let your imagination turn fantasy into reality hahaaa.....there is actually a University to go and study fantasy...you could learn all you could imagine lol!!
How is the weather in your area ?
Nice chatting with you! It is a perfect plan. we cannot fail.
Would you see the Silence of the Lambs on Valentine's day? That's the day it came out in 1991. It made over $270 million in box office.
I enjoy music and dance. What is your favorite video game?
Yes, I wouldn't be able to function without a car. I don't live close to anything and have to drive everywhere. How about yourself.
Yes, and dogs can donate blood to other dogs. Do your Huskies resemble wolves in any way - to you?
I watch a lot of comedy stuff, How i met your mother, friends, the good place, the santa clarita diet, stuff like that, easy stuff. I do like a lot of drama though, like westworld, the handmaids tale etc.
Have you had to face any racism regarding your physical characteristics in your life? I have not had to, I am thankful for the jobs that I have had that I've worked in many environments as the minority race.
Siri isn't even compatible with Spotify on the Homepod. When your assistant can't talk to your music to play on your speakers, there's a problem!
So, Did you even realize that Comedy Central has cancelled over 100 shows since 1989??
I do. You yourself? And I believe that google is the largest search engine, although Youtube is owned by Google if I am not mistaken.
lol weird.  Been great chatting with you!
I bet you could. show off to your fellow geeks and programmers! classic style! anyway, great chat!
I know. It was really nice chatting with you.
I can't even imagine working that hard for a role and not getting it! I did watch Ironman all the way thru. How bout you?
I see your point it does look like a silly thing to do, do you like Tim Duncan, he is also another great player.
wow so crazy, now he showed them why he should have passed! Enjoy your day!
Yeah same here, I like to be able to at least play every sport just a bit once. Do you follow tennis at all?
I've heard of these cocktail places that do drinks using liquid nitrogen, you're meant to let it evaporate before ingesting. I can imagine when you've had a few drinks your sense of caution get lost.
Nice, that is cool. Do you like dogs?
Good morning. How are your investments today?
If you got it why not? He is worth over 20 billion dollars after all.
Yah, it's quite a bit larger than a baseball for sure, I've never seen a softball video game though, have you?
Nice! Did you see the first movie when it came out in 1977? I remember going to the theater to see it.
So what would be your team, which jersey would you want for a tweet?
When you buy a product, you get something in return. If you do not buy something, like facebook, youare the product. They are selling you to others through your data or ads.
That is too bad. DO you like Drake?
I did and loved it so much, and you?
that is a great idea! get your friends to tweet too! Have a good day!
I like both. I feel like they go somewhat hand in hand. There's nothing like going down the road windows down, blaring your favorite song.
I haven't heard of them until recently. I think it's a funny concept, to poke fun at some of Hollywood's worst productions, but I feel bad for the nominees! Have you seen them?
True.   Then again, if you are recording on a houseboat like Pink Floyd, it doesn't much matter if your ship is going down!
I'll be joining you!  Crocodiles are more closely related to birds than they are to snakes and lizards.  Odd fact.
exactly. pretend you need to ride away from the horror. LOL So, do you like the internet? or is it the bane of your existence?
Hi there, do you enjoy watching movies?
Lol, well it's been nice chatting with you this lovely, fine Florida afternoon.  I got to go wash my cat, if you know what I mean, I'll talk to you later, friend.
Is the sun blocking your internet signal tonight?
Wow that is really fast, I bet you can get to your destination in no time, do you like to travel?
Lol, good luck getting that to work. Maybe throw up a huge speaker into space and blast your sound from there.
Yes it is. Mostly by oceans but also lakes, rivers, and other sources! Well it was lovely getting to talk with you!
it's a funny thing.  i used to read a lot but these days i spend more time listening to music but i have been thinking about getting back into the reading.  who are some of your fav authors?
Wow great information, I will have to try that sometime. Do you like to eat fish or even go fishing?
I loved to play Pokemon, did you ever played the game or watched the series?
I will have to check that out lol! It was so nice chatting with you, enjoy your weekend!
That is a bit invasive, they can track your location and all, your cellphone can get hacked and then a stalker will know your every move
There you go! Send that idea to them! Especially since all these consoles are made in China! Might be a secret plan!
Would you steal a garden gnome to take on your road trip and then return the gnome with photos?
Yeah and also, many people don't know there's really no correlation between connection quality and service bars either. To answer your question, I'm not sure. What does Minnie Mouse stand for?
I guess he's not the lowest key Prime Minister you could get. I guess many politicians get in the news for unflattering circumstances now and then.
I do as well! Were you a subscriber even back when their whole business model was about DVD rental by mail and not an online platform?
I do too, I don't particularly like him. Did you vote last election
Hey how is it going, you ever cook a turkey during Thanksgiving?
That is amazing. Have you seen the movie Blazing Saddles?
I know, I haven't seen it. How lucky to find baseball cards in your grandfathers attic worth 3 million dollars! Good chat!!
Yeah I guess talent runs in the family. Do you now how many hours of video games we play in a week as a planet?
They are indeed very smart and that proves it. Nice chatting with you.
True! Do you ever Listen to Taylor Swift?
I did, but I rather watch the games than to play them on a video game console, do you like baseball?
Have you ever played the game yourself, I have not, I'm not originally from the US.
Me too! But, we still can watch it being played. Who's your favorite player?
That's unusual, I've never thought of heavy metal as literature, but ok. Who's your favorite author?
That's really cool that you seem to be in good spirits about it, much like the little boy. I guess an event like that can really change your overall perspective.
Then maybe you could try the deaf rapper, Signmark. He rhymes in sign language! You don't have to listen at all! I'm going to go try to find some on the internet. Goodbye!
Those pucks look dangerous flying around.  I understand that most other countries understand hockey to mean field hockey.  I guess it depend on if your country is cold or not.
Yeah that's horrible! interesting that the term "robotic" was created by a science fiction author, you'd think that it would have been an actual science term, and this happened back in 1941 haha
I didnt, he has a great voice! you know that Stephen Fry is also a game narrator, he narrater the voice for some games
Yeah, too bad for them. Do you like comedy?
I wonder if someone was fired at fox because of George Lucas deal. Anyway, I've got to run. Nice chatting with you.
Hi did you ever play with Nintendo?
Not any more but I used to.  I do like knowing that in Norway the government will buy copies your book that you publish and put them in libraries.  It sounds like they really support their libraries.
Good, yourself? do you listen to music?
I think so too.  Well, my wife is asking me to go get some whipping cream for some chicken soup so I am going to wrap it up.  Nice chatting with you.
That guy was everywhere. Did you ever watch wall-e?
I have. I heard that he started a library in 1895 with 32,000 books in it. All from his personal collection. Can you imagine?
Talented guy, what are your thoughts on the goatees some of the pleyers grow?
I do watch basketball on occasion. Which is your favorite team?
Do you like Leonardo DiCaprio? He got his start in the 1980's sitcom Growing Pains...
Is her name Anne Jones ? If yes you could put a generator on your books and sell the electricity. Do you enjoy reading ?
I made a note with mine as well. I wrote it down. I say the last day I worked March ninth.
but it is crazy, I can't get along with my family; in fact, they had a great Christmas this year, Christmas is really good. You will be doing the holiday stuff
teach me as they say, teach me like how we are responsible
now you can't kick me out
Oh my God, how long am I gonna
Yeah, I get all the stuff from there
In progress. Let's see. Now, retail, where I shop from?
why are they telling me to take an order? Anyway. So, I'm like, oh my God.
Now you can't kick me out, sorry. Do you know where is this thing
That's interesting to me because ketchup is my favourite thing. I'll even think of things to eat, just so I can get some ketchup.
but I think they are, I just think that sooner or later it's gonna crumble.
It's crazy. Excuse me. I'm so sorry. it's crazy cause I had a very similar situation. Basically, my cousin, who's int the bronx, was walking, but what?
trying to sell me stuff but in the most aggressive way I have ever experienced. And try to cheat me in any way they can possibly could.
But yes, I was not motivated, it seemed too hard to me. And with Spanish, I figured, my thought at the time was that I would learn Spanish,
my thing was always sports and stuff, well with my dad, it was just like playing sports and football was his thing
Oh yeah makes sense . crazy, oh my goodness well I don't know . I do wanna go but I, where do you stay? Because what she told me
So tell me more about that.
It's like that I just think it's away.
I hope so, so I could put them in sports, but I can't wait, but I've always been telling my kids a lot
that's nice mine not so much
raspberry or peach are kind of my favorites. don't really like passion for coconut tastes too much like a pina colada. So in general, I prefer the raspberry and strawberry or the peach
Once I was there when there was the Boston Marathon bombing and I remember we all, everyone - after they found - and got the guy into custody everyone including me, my friends there converged on the
Yeah, you can get that anywhere. walmart, CVS personally, myself, I used to enjoy walking down electronics stores.
and my dad was like, oh, that guy has got his life together? That's really less than when he was working for me, he was working for me and also running
I remember I went for my birthday and the older waitresses sang happy birthday to me.
No, I am like, my mouth is open like come on give it to me. I am drinking the tea.
I love mores. Yeah, last semester, me and my boyfriend spent a weekend hiking it was so nice.
Recently my sister told me that they've decided that they're going to keep kosher in their kitchen. So that members of their community will feel comfortable coming over and eating at their house.
that's the sort of my take on it like I wouldn't want to live my life and in prison and I sometimes wonder you know how other people feel about that
people were checking for me, so I was like, okay whatever. So she was like, oh! Come meet me and my friends and we are gonna have some wine,
You know like my partner is mine. But, I guess it's not that uncommon.
It was the third-largest city but pardon me?
I'm not gonna it's myself, I'm not moving back in. I fixed, you know, we fixed, it's just everything is so fucked up. I keep thinking about it too
I like it a lot. So that was Egypt and then I had to get myself back to um it was like a lot of work
I wouldn't want to be in the position where to have my mom asking my friends' moms to ask my friends to ask me to hang out, you know?
And what if probably my favourite and then I like documentary type stuff about musicians
Yeah but my friends helped me through it. Because they were there
I know I need to because it irritates me every month when I have to pay it, I can't believe I have to pay this is so much money.
Yeah, I am saying the same thing. However, I think I came to the realization like okay I am trying to get up and go entertain myself and be with some bro zone
Who are our other friends? Lauren Adelman is a friend of mine, my friend Leigh.
you're gonna really have to consider who you invite over. You know why Stephanie did you never invite me over? Well, you exceed the maximum height limit in my home.
She just sends me this random stuff and I'm just very specific about my home and how I create my household,
It took me by surprise, you would not believe and my husband remembers that I would have some low backache and I know it was from playing soccer in the cold weather.
plan and be spontaneous and a little bit of everything, not everything planned for me that's just not fun. But my funniest vacation
No, that's true. I mean like then, in mine front too. Girl, I went to high school with, She'd moved out to California after graduation and then a couple of years moved back
Definitely, it's just like because of my parents.
My wife told me that sometimes I raise my voice.
and you get a new computer, up the old computer systems, my whole guides and it is not so easy to just make the backup of the drive.
well, this is the exact word for word verbatim that my other store manager told me todo. Do you want to consult and come back to me?
You know Frank how is it gonna be. the insurance company was going to give me (ten thousand dollars) for my hit and run case with Frank
And he wants me to help him do it, so now he's carrying his Ipad over here. Come on!
When are you going to see me, it's true about.
If small things, this is the same, same price I won't buy it there, but anything that's like, there are certain things that they match up on price things to target Walmart.
me and Kamella and my sister Lizzy we went to pick lavender
you know, over a year, I had become very attached to this person. And, it wasn't healthy for me anymore, because I wanted more and he, he was never gonna want more.
I don't know. I mean, I don't honestly like if it was me that situation like they'd be doing me a favour.
I mean I've done all of my vacations myself.
and they are both talking to the same girl and my boyfriend, Jazz, that invited me, said, my brother who is dating this girl who we both met online and they are engaged,
Really? I wonder why mine is so expensive?
told me that we were gonna do. And maybe I can hear him a little bit in my ear as I'm waiting on the crab.
I mean. Does it really concern me? No. but do I want the new emojis when they come out? Yeah. They just actually released a bunch more
and was laughing and she was like I just reported this girl Instagram to the principal and everyone was like laughing about it and I called my dad and I was like please come pick me up
My in-laws suck, my wife's mother could be a low funny she'd be funny with stuff, and she's just weird
So my camera was all misty, the child could barely see me. She could hear me, but we made a connection
I feel like that's something my in-laws are doing and I would be having a relationship with my wife, but family come in it and just always got something negative to say and always got a problem
I'm gonna move away from my window, cause that's really annoying me.
So all that to say a housemate of mine did a webinar yesterday,
I hate myself and I hate my life.
me and my friend used to take street football really seriously, really touch and whatnot. Especially during the winter when it was snowing, we would love to just go outside and touch and have these
taller than me.
I or it wouldn't be so new to them but on the other hand, it's like, well, if I can do it myself
The day people try to cheat me and lie to me, and take advantage of me walking around the pyramids. But the pyramids are amazing.
Go to speak his mind like me, he does so that's why it seems to reason when he says we
What is it like, I'd really like it to write more but I cannot really have that much to write, I don't have anything that sticks.
I want to go home, how may let me get out of here, the food sucks, you can't really and then I would see the wedding photographers as well.
But to me it's just like when I was on my bike trip, I remember I just crossed into California, I think it was called city or something like that, I can't remember.
What do they think I did? I didn't do anything to make a crime, what do you want from me?
Like very tiny, small. Anchorman was actually the movie that me and my husband connected over. I know you do.
Is that the link that you sent me? Cause they can't find it.
I got the forums down in the courts and how to edit. I can fill them out myself.
and my foot has pretty much stopped growing so it was time for me to really settle in until receive it and I did like months of research
okay. let me just ask you Do I sound okay? Because I just had to make an adjustment to my microphone. I want to make sure that I'm still coming in clear and not too loud.
Not really, my parents tried to get me, but I was too nervous because of the French
and my parents and my in-laws and my kids. I just.
school to do something like that. And also being trapped with my family on a boat for like weeks at a time. That sounds kind of bad to me
but he's sweet and smart. He does remind me a lot of my baby.
So sometimes the struggle is in the morning for me my whole thing is the coffee, I got to have my coffee first thing in the morning.
and my mom got it for me
That's good because years ago they would, I, because there's some old family stories of mine and like nobody's too sure.
about stuff that's my next goal, just having my family secure. Where they ain't gotta worry about stuff
I wanted a friend of mine, a friend of my dad, is a lawyer and he is a friend of his
Oh yeah, it's true I guess. And you know, it surprises me that surprises that Berlin are, you know, any of Jessy's until now
cooperate with the agency then getting to him, in fact without me being there. So I'm sure they're trying to do that too. So by sooner or later they're gonna come up with that.
I mean, I think that people are gonna have to get I don't know. It's tough because I haven't seen myself now getting,
I was like, yo, mom this lady ain't cool. Nah! If you know what I mean. How could she be sitting on my couch drinking our water and tell me what to do while she is
quote, unquote like (Bond) girls that they have, it was that great sixties costuming and stuff but I never really thought it was very funny either but confused me was different
If the Chinese people are in the market, and you know they are, they have to be used to
Based on your work with her and based on what you know of Brad, so far this seems like a solid thing.
What is your ideal profession?
my cousins down south, they are always looking out, North Carolina, they come to New York, everybody loves New York, their family want to see
That sounds like that makes a lot of sense, your next step.
So does it feel like that school is part of your family values growing up
Not like you're trying to make it a bigger deal. but that might be when you're trying to do things with ease, that might be how it works out.
what's your favourite TV show at the moment.
you know what I am saying they always help you out, whatever you need, your family got your back
close by who is diverting your attention.
it up and try to refund yours, but I cannot guarantee this.
Also your financial so it's everything you have to take into consideration. But I can't believe that if it costs that much to eat in the future.
Do you have any favourite memories of your friends or like have you ever like a ride on them or is there a story that I definitely wanna know?
Why don't your dad guess number or anything?
So you take that packaging that came in, you couldn't buy back in this same thing.
they have to be, that's their deal, they have to make, it's the same thing that has happened with Home Depot
Yeah my parents were talking about going there and traveling there and stuff and all of that, but let's talk about the in-laws, how did you get along with your wife?
you close the account and you can do that online, you can give the cause and then closing my account tomorrow and my my sister's
Alright, the payment went through. Thanks for choosing AMC, enjoy your movie. You have a good time.
I don't know about this. I don't know if that's ever happened to you, I mean having (your arm bit mouth) is pretty significant
Okay no your flight is not cancelled until you have received a confirmation from us, you need to contact us as early as possible, different airlines have different rules from how late.
Oh my God, you can just throw it back into the package, it doesn't even make a difference, as a matter of fact, as soon as UPS gets it, they will refund your money.
You know they start off young. They start off when you young, you know what I mean. Take you to the basketball. Go play basketball, football
I cannot believe it. You know honestly, I could see how this is like, for people who need to or if you are a professional talker like you would
What did your friend think about all this? Are you an adventurous spirit? He just goes along and seemed to enjoy it or what?
Yeah, that's Walmart that's way better, you can get all of these things in Walmart
Well, what was your profession before that?
everybody's favourite show is Martin. Why is your favourite show, Martin?
Did your family push back at all when you told them you were vegetarian?
That's nice. That's something that you can do with your students just to kill time if you have.
Then you can put in your pocket and use when you want to flip it out, it's a full screen.
Yeah, or on your phone. So, you know, super funky stuff. That I think that's the best way to describe it, as funky.
but their prices are just so great, and then they have so many things that you have just sort of try
That is so tempting. I'm kinda keeping it to this tape I can hear you smiling, is making me want to ask other things. So who is your favourite couple?
You know what I mean? that instant gratification that relies on you know, this is a game, it's in my control, sort of making that all work. What what are your thoughts on that?
The stinky part about being a public school, private school teacher, even I didn't have that much in homeschooling is having to correct all of your students' homework in your time off.
That's between First and A and it was on the Uptown side of the street.
It's just your mic is blasting in my ear. I got up to lower it.
When you do, when you have a child that you're responsible for, you got to get your ducks in a row.
it doesn't stop, it just grows, everything grows, you know what I am saying
Yeah, exactly. Okay now also have a look on my fashion stores where do you shop?
I think it's not just for an interview. There's a lot of people that say, just do it every morning and yet it changes your day.
being a student in school, you know what I mean? It's definitely helpful. It's convenient I mean your full-time student does not really have a car.
they have really good yoghurt that's super cheap and they have different kinds of chips and packages, hummus and cheese
Why watch on your phone?
what do I like about my work? what you like about your makeup and about doing makeup?
Sure, may I get your card information?
He's really affectionate he'll come up to you and be laying on you and rubbing your face and nice you know just a sweet baby.
That's why they are all cool, they are a little crazy, you know what I am saying?
I think he did because when I talked to him he was very positive about what your conversation was
What was your last vacation?
I get them calling and they were like you know, you talk to conversement but that's like the deal is gonna be approved and then and then I
I actually read a book or, imagine, I read a book on your love language and learning it, your attachment styles and stuff with your partner
Well, as I can see, what I think is you know there are so venture fund stack that seems that
between meters and just everything, and even just worrying about your car getting clipped. Parking is a real pain in the butt. How do you find parking in Astoria?
you know, very smart move but, it's just expensive, you know what I mean it's like you really want to buy that
Yeah. How about your childhood friends from your community that you grew up with?
Yeah, if you can spend the money it's definitely on your side.
that's not true. English is your first language.
think of your iPhone, if you could just fold your iPhone in half.
we can talk a little bit about the Oscars. I'm wondering if I can just hear about your favourite movies at the moment. Both for a year, going into the awards season
your mom always sounds so like
just having that net there, it's big community so family is your immediate family, then the people behind you,
I don't get it. Am I just really old and out of touch but, it seems to me like ridiculous.
it is like the more you could just always be adding new family, always be adding new members, always be adding new possibilities to what you need to do
That hurts your stomach, okay. I think you're lactose intolerant.
They are trying to refund your money back into an Amazon credit so why they don't return to your credit card.
we have my routine. What's your routine?
Hey Summer how was your day today?
You know what I'm saying, whatever you wanna do you could do it. Provide you for everything you wanna do.
We would also talk about that like our timeline and we will talk about your family, your family tree but we should try and do that, you and me. Have you looked up the prices.
So, okay, lemme see, lemme test your age and see if I can guess. I think you're about my age. How was the, how do you, what's the oldest way you remember to get the prizes?
That is really amazing. So I am noticing that with my voice now it has that same low little lines that yours did before instead of the bigger ones.
My old team was definitely much larger than yours when I work at the restaurant.
my boyfriend Sam has a message saved somewhere like the message that was going to your room.
Yeah so like, when you go in and buy your phone for example, that's from T-mobile or any T-mobile
I just see how I can be without a degree. there are so many jobs you can't enable yourself into new jobs anymore.
you have to order all bunch of stuff, but you know, they're not making money on that either but suck it,
If you can just get yourself incarcerated maybe everything would work out.
watched show and all that, she watched videos, people you know what I am saying?
So your pops It's like that tell a story differently.
So you feel like he told you, so his father must have been born.
That's true. but yeah, that's another thing when friends don't budget correctly and then they're out there and your like I'm not giving you money.
It was a better consistency than the rest of the food but frankly I always like medium. Yeah how long was your cruise for? Was it like
I can accommodate your agenda, but it's always just like a problem like for example when I first met Joseph
you know what I am saying get off me
I have seen that I've seen he is getting a little taller and you've got to start checking him soon, try to fight that
that is a real way, it is a real sure-fire way to remove yourself from reality, and that is why I hated it.
Okay. The first topic is my favorite movie. What's your favorite movie?
Just thought he would be born with like just your family.
Yeah, it's like moving from college except you're under a microscope.
Yeah, it can crank it out on your eyes.
I mean, what are yours, I know that you don't know the game as well as I do, but, you know, what are your thoughts on
You got it. So, if Martin was your favourite show growing up, what's your favourite show now?
That's so sweet. I was gonna say who is your friend group in high school?
how they can benefit society, just being who they are, because the more they be who they are, it's just more beneficial you know?
It's like a really nice TV for forty bucks or something and he literally ran to the Fourteenth Street at ten o'clock at night, but you have this.
It needs to be the culture of customer service and making it an experience for people rather than just coming in
she gave them back to him and she said Peter I want you to find your co-pilot and it was so cute
Please, tell me the rates for both options.
Hi. This is George. I think we talked on the phone a few days ago about my trip to Grande El something, I think?
Oh, okay. So I wouldn't need to call back in again. I can just do it online?
a hundred percent non-smoking, like I really am a pest to make sure, because I am allergic to it. I can not stand it at all.
What should I do if I need special assistance?
See, about that, Joey. I have a problem with that because a couple of months ago actually I did give out my contact information and
Oh, most definitely, it's possible. So let me also tell you the options that we have, because before, we only had either pay cash, or either pay in points, but now we have the new option.
Okay, yup, here it is, I see it. And I just need to click on the link. Alright, so I've clicked on it.
Yeah, I'm here. Hi Amy! How did it go?
Okay, is there anything I need to take care of
If it's possible, I do need to discuss this with the head of the bank though. As it goes, decisions like that go pretty high up, so
After that, it was actually to this satellite dish company. And after a week, I started receiving all this spam emails and all these SMSs with like
Great. What is the check-in time for the room? And I might need early check-in if it's possible?
Yeah, sure, I understand that. Let me think, because I do wanna make a surprise for my husband, to be honest, but
Okay, great, so let's hope I'll be there bright and early tomorrow.
Hi Joey, how you doing? I want to book a room and a spa facility. I got something special going on for me and my husband, we have an anniversary, so
I believe I have security on mine and it won't let us do it, so it's gonna be her name, which is Vanessa, common spelling. Last name it's Hendrix. The number is
Yes, I did. And just for our own company policy, and to avoid any mistakes, we're gonna go ahead and repeat it phonetically, okay? So, it'll be John.
Well, I apologize for my use of grammar.
He's not answering the mic. I'm pressing on me. I'm at the office. My guys are out there pressing the button. They're whooping and hollering over the
Okay, is this going to take long, because I got my kids to pick up from school?
Oh, okay. Not a problem. So let me check the details here, let me check my system.
And also I wanted to know if you guys provide any type of airport shuttle and if you guys can accommodate me and give me an early check-in, please.
Let me think. Did you mention DVD players at all?
I am putting through that CVV number on my pad and I, okay, yes, it's done. Now, you can proceed.
Hi, Alex. This is Amy Bush. I actually need to make travel arrangements to Sacramento, for a high profile client of mine. So it's very important for me to
Yep, that is correct. That's my number.
When would I be given a bassinet?
Oh, Porto Le Grando? Yeah. That must've been me. Are you excited?
Is there anything else that I should be aware of, as far as children policy?
If a member of my family is taken ill and no longer wishes to travel due to this, I'm entitled for a refund?
Alright, so I'm putting that CVV number onto my dial-pad and yup, there you go, go ahead and please proceed.
Yes, I was, I had a blocked artery and I was exerting myself when shoveling gravel. It was very heavy and I had to go to the emergency room with my son and my daughter.
So, what are you telling me, son? You're telling me that I need the purchase order separately or what?
And please provide me a good valid email address. That way, once we're done making the reservation for the smoking room, I can tell you the confirmation via that way.
Most definitely. Please go ahead and proceed to get me those fifty shares.
That way it can help me grow plants and the pacers and everything needed.
That sounds great. So please go ahead and book the gold room for me.
Yeah, go ahead and give that early check-in for me around ten o'clock in the morning. That will be perfect.
Okay, I have a Visa here. Let me just get it out of my wallet. Let me put my glasses on, because those numbers are so small. I can hardly see them to just
Yeah, I'm pretty well through, but I mean, all my friends are counting on me, they're all very risk averse. So they just, anyway, just in case, you know.
No. This is the first time I'm taking a loan.
Okay, okay, that does sound good, like I said. And just another quick question, I was wondering, what about the hotels during this trip?
Let me tell you that a fee of fifty dollars is to be paid towards the same thing due to limited inventory for accommodating infants per fly.
My email is at the time not valid and not working, and I prefer not to give it out.
Yeah, Joey, about that, I don't really feel very comfortable giving out all those details, cause I had a problem a couple months ago with that. I gave out my information to this
So, I have to stress this out. It's very important for me to be in a single and non-smoking room, please.
So the room is booked. I got a message the amount was already deducted from the bank, so I basically already have it booked and I have nothing to worry about. I arrive at the airport
What happened is that I gave out my information to this insurance company, and they just gave the information to a third party which then went on and sold the information somewhere else I guess.
Thanks for giving me the detailed information.
Okay. I have a requirement but I want to know some other information. I would like to know what is the actual rate of interest for this?
Oh, it should be Peter, my name.
Wow! That does sound really good. So let's see. I think I'm going to book the suite for me and my request is I would like to have meals served
until April fifth would be really good for me. Yeah, April third until April fifth, if it's possible, please.
I don't know, is there any way that we could like move it out so that I can order faster?
Let me go ahead. And you need my account number or my mobile number or something like that?
Alright, what are the check-in times of the room and I might need early check-in as well, because we're arriving a little bit earlier than when we're supposed to.
Okay, perfect. It's not a big deal. We're still in the process of moving, so it doesn't really matter. But yeah, okay, I will just keep an eye out for it, I guess.
Yes, of course, this is going to be under my name, that will be Tom Brady.
So I want to pay a lot.
The first name is John and the last name is Margaretta. So I'm going to go ahead and repeat it again, it's John Margaretta, okay?
Please confirm me the rate as well, since I have some other business to take care of.
And how can I locate the store details of payback partners?
And if you guys have a shuttle, you know, if that's free, that would be great. It would save me some money. But yes, I will need early check-in.
I would like to know about a baggage policy on which I am having some confusions.
Yeah, no problem. Just make sure not to give up my personal information please, because I don't really like that, and I've had trouble with that in the past. But my email address is
Okay, please proceed. I already did that.
Certainly, I've put in that CVV on my iPad and also on my dial pad. So, yeah. Yep, it is done. Go ahead and proceed.
I believe that would be easier, all my information is already saved.
Alright, I've got it up here now. Go ahead and provide me the new address so I can send the team out there.
Well, I appreciate that you provided me those details. Now I am informed of that.
I mean, I apologize for the confusion, I am limited by what our system allows me to do.
We have a slogan, brings it back to me. If you can't deliver it, we don't leave our steps. We bring it back.
Well, that sounds really good. Please book a suite room for me and my request is to serve the meals at my room. I would like room services if possible.
How can I proceed for the booking?
When should I submit the passport and how many days does it take for visa stamp and stuff like that?
is the same if I haven't canceled.
About a month ago, I gave out my phone number and my email address to this insurance company, and I don't know what they did. I think they probably
Yeah. I told you that I have to talk to my boss about that. Yes.
Yeah, Joe. About that I had a problem with this information a couple of months ago because I gave out my number and my email address to the satellite dish company when they were doing the installation.
Alright, you said tracking. Here, let me see. Here, hold on! Let me put my glasses on. Here, hold on! Alright, then. Here you go. Click, is done. Go ahead and please proceed with the situation.
Okay, perfect. We'll see, let me check my schedule. It looks like I have an opening tomorrow afternoon.
Oh yeah! Early check-in would be a plus, you know, my flight is actually landing around ten AM.
Oh, straight to business, just want my money.
Alright, so listen, I just got a message on my phone and it says that the amount is already deducted from the bank. Does that mean that the room is actually booked already?
Well, to be honest, I think pretty much I've gotten the information. As I said earlier, I will have to speak with my husband and we're gonna decide what we're gonna do,
It's just that my brain is working and I'm just constantly having new questions. And I just wanted to know, well, how can I locate the store details of payback partners? How can I find them where they are?
Also please bear in mind that all this information provided is strictly confidential. This information will be only used for our internal usage, so I will put all the information in our system
Sure thing. You can proceed now. I already gave that information to them.
with an additional bed. So I need a single room with an additional bed, please.
using maps to get home, to the office, to client's offices, to the grocery store, to the gas station. I don't know my way around anywhere and then besides that I have to be
When should I submit the passport, and how many days does it take for a visa stamp and stuff like that?
Yeah, Joey, about that, I do have a problem with giving out my personal information, because I had a situation that was very uncomfortable a couple of months ago.
Yes, I am. Please go ahead and proceed.
But I think I might need an early check-in in the room, because I think my flight arrived kind of early.
Yes, I will. Can I require a cab too?
Oh, okay, so this month I'll still get the paper mail, then?
And I don't know if that sounds okay.
That sounds really great. So go ahead and please book the presidential room for me and I would like to be near the pool.
We're talking about money here, you know. Time is money, and you know, business do matters.
Wow! That does sound good because it's pretty much summertime. So where is your office?
Okay. Now, Mister Stewart, thanks for that information, there. Okay. I do have that down. Now, I do need your date of birth as well, if you don't mind?

And more comfortable. So that's exactly what I will need now. So, yeah. And do you guys have any Starbucks nearby?

Okay, great. And may I have your full name, please?
So I will need an early check-in and if you have a shuttle airport shuttle, that will be great.
You said it was yourself, your wife and how many children? Let's start off with that.

Have you had any scuba diving in your past, and if so, can you explain?
the number of your credit card, in order for us to go on and make the booking.
Alright, yeah, so you will receive a confirmation email. I just need an email address to

I'm assuming when I get there, everybody or your employees will be wearing a mask. I also have a mask, gloves and goggles that I am going to be using as soon as I arrive there.
All you can eat, it includes all your drinks and there's some packages to discuss, but there's some other amenities that we can add.
Okay, that sounds good. I will be happy to provide you with all the details but first I am going to need some contact information from you,
Please give me the first and last name as mentioned on your passport, please.
the amount that you can get is, so I'd really like to express my opinion. Is that on the phone? Do I just stay on the line?
I'm also gonna send it to your email address and this is gonna be everything that you need to know, just as a reminder.
and the night of the eighteenth. So, you'll be checking out at noon on the nineteenth, and yes, I have good news for you, the gold room is actually available for the required days.
