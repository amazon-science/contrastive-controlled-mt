- Brief description of each system submitted, including which system they prefer for final evaluation by the organizers
We submitted two systems: 1) en-hi, and 2) en-ja. Both systems are unconstrained supervised tasks. Each system provides 3 system outputs: formal and informal hypotheses for formality control task, and a NMT hypothesis for generic testset. 


- System performance on the generic test set as computed by the participant
For en-hi, we report BLEU score of 38.9 on newstest2014. COMET score: 0.8741
For en-ja, report BLEU score of 19.4 (Mecab-segmented) on newstest2020. COMET score: 0.3783


- Training data conditions 
The submission focuses on unconstrained and supervised training task

- List of the data sources used for training the system
We have used 1) IWSLT train and test data provided by the organizer; 2)  WikiMatrix, JParaCrawl, IIT-Bombay for NMT finetuning; 3) newstest2020  for en-ja evaluation and newstest2014 for en-hi evaluation.
