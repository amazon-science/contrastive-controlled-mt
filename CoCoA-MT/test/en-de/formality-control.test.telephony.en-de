you're walking through the building, you're going slowly with your big bag. It was like get the fuck out of the way. It's not a hotel
Got it. Any of your family members ever done something to put like you're on the famous.
Just thought he would be born with like just your family.
Because I know in California, they passed a bill saying If you wanna opt out of companies taking their tax, your tax your data, you can do that.
I don't know if your phone backs up automatically or if (you've lost) if you don't have enough memory, but that seems like that would be really important.
If you can just get yourself incarcerated maybe everything would work out.
you understand.
my boyfriend Sam has a message saved somewhere like the message that was going to your room.
because we knew that they weren't gonna continue to buy if they are going to but it seems that the Amazon made it possible like they can give you just like print out the label
well, all should be like in your paperwork, what times that they can contact you, what to do
Then you can put in your pocket and use when you want to flip it out, it's a full screen.
How was your day?
No, so is your friend staying there permanently, where do the children staying and how is her relationship with their husband and how are things there because of work or is he closer to his family.
you tell me yours and I will get back to you on that.
and you're gonna wanna get rid of it anyway and it's just gonna go to the goodwill or to a buffalo exchange if they'll take it and it's not everything is meant to just be replaced
I would certainly never buy it for myself. I like some of the doughnuts that we had that are like dough. What's that place that we used to go on your way to work?
your car now I know it sounds callous but as I said sometimes I think that is a more favourable option anyway.
you never know what you could take from another culture and incorporate into your own and make it better.
your plans for the future like what type you are generally speaking?
I can accommodate your agenda, but it's always just like a problem like for example when I first met Joseph
you know what I am saying get off me
you can add more friendly and new members in just throught that
The phone, I think, things that are going to be able to do things. You know, like, let's use your eyes to, like, have the page go down and stuff like that.
But it's also hard to see when your friend isn't happy
What are your favorite road trips that you've ever taken?
Now you, where do you work currently? A pizzeria. Is this what you, this isn't your career though?
I just see how I can be without a degree. there are so many jobs you can't enable yourself into new jobs anymore.
Ok, so for your career though, I think you're gonna have to look more professional. Is that something you've thought about at all?
Now they are your family members I don't know what word to use here.
So you feel like he told you, so his father must have been born.
Can I have your phone number from which you called us previously?
think of your iPhone, if you could just fold your iPhone in half.
yeah, family will always be there, especially moms and pops, the moms always take care of you
Yeah. What about yourself? What do you do?
what's yours like?
So you've got to work a nice balance in between
after a certain time at night or she won't answer text messages like on Sundays or something like that. So you are like setting boundaries for yourself
You know they start off young. They start off when you young, you know what I mean. Take you to the basketball. Go play basketball, football
Ok, so how has telecom improved your life?
you could get GoogleTV which I have now, it's like fifty dollars a month and you can get channels, so you get everything to get the history channel, but you get
you close the account and you can do that online, you can give the cause and then closing my account tomorrow and my my sister's
Excuse me. Does your job require a uniform?
That sounds like that makes a lot of sense, your next step.
now mom's always looking out, she always looks out you know what I am saying, I give her money all the time
I mean it's a little weird, you are working on the weekend, so it's like you know
I said from the grapevine what I heard your family isn't as large but you know there is nothing wrong with that
close by who is diverting your attention.
a stranger off the street like your average Joe, you know, like they could be, it's too different. I mean people will throw people off.
do your own thing, which was awesome and it was a great place to be. I don't know if you have any location that struck? You guys are international travel.
Yeah. How about your childhood friends from your community that you grew up with?
and I was like, hey do you want to get something off the menu and your looking at the menu. And it took us a while to decide anyway. So we get a beer
you know that you gotta go to school for that, you know what I am saying.
So, okay, lemme see, lemme test your age and see if I can guess. I think you're about my age. How was the, how do you, what's the oldest way you remember to get the prizes?
if you are gonna get diner food, like Denny's is not gonna be your best culinary option.
I'm pretty good, I had a very interesting morning. I'll tell you about it while you handle your texts and stuff.
Yeah, like even HBO you can get through crime.
You can't type anything in yours, but with our program, we can select pre-determined comments. So, you can say that the child was distracted, you can say they were off task,

Now, it's easier to get your money back, but back then it was a whole big thing and you know
You don't really know exactly where it's coming from and so it's tough to put all your faith in that.
watched show and all that, she watched videos, people you know what I am saying?
Oh, on each side, that's crazy if you got ten on this side, ten on that side, is it mostly boys, there are girls
What did your friend think about all this? Are you an adventurous spirit? He just goes along and seemed to enjoy it or what?
I might sound strange, but I feel like people buy less electronics these days because everything has been condensed. Like, my phone, your cellphone, is like ten things
all the time values that you learned from your family.
you know that, parents are just so important like everything you are doing in life and just gone, especially my father will be crazy
talk to your friends about stuff like this I don't know you don't want to
I think every other way other than that is a worse way. If someone said hey your family is going through a little bit of a crisis okay, don't worry it's nothing that they, it happens to everyone
Okay. The first topic is my favorite movie. What's your favorite movie?
Yeah, that's Walmart that's way better, you can get all of these things in Walmart
I just want them to do them. You know what I mean.

Maybe you're going to some kind of event or restaurant. When you're doing something like that, how much thought do you put into your outfit?
So what is your profession? How would you describe that?
Or head over to the mall and just spend your worries away. And then look at the state's credit card statement in a month and get more worried.
I don't need your advice, I just need your cash.
it doesn't stop, it just grows, everything grows, you know what I am saying
I mean I do once in a while if there is something specific l am looking for, you know a good piece of fish or something or that I know that's not frozen
Not in your mouth. Don't put that in your mouth. Don't put that in your mouth!
where is your family originally come from where do you guys are if you point on a map
Wow, today you could play with them so they could meet them too
Doing better, of course, the other thing is the whole tax situation, which is the return for an independent contractor so you know, or you have to be responsible for paying your taxes quarterly and you know?
I think even your PayPal email address.
It's okay I mean, he said he's going to pay via PayPal and can you just text me your PayPal?
it's not in your control you are born into it which is what I was asking you that question earlier of which family would you be in
I actually read a book or, imagine, I read a book on your love language and learning it, your attachment styles and stuff with your partner
what do I like about my work? what you like about your makeup and about doing makeup?
I'll violate and whatever because people, it's none of your business. What if I'm babysitting?

I cannot believe it. You know honestly, I could see how this is like, for people who need to or if you are a professional talker like you would
the same as recycling styrofoam,it's like you have to put them into landfill and it stays there forever, and unwanted clothing now is like all-time high
So you worked out yourself naturally. Okay, that's great.

We don't think you should go if you can't find your wallet and I was like, no, I can find it. So I got it and then we went downtown
Yeah, it was nice to be out somewhere warm. I thought you said that you and your sister got
So, they're not all, so, what I meant by on the same level or on a different level is not necessarily how yours was done up. I know your company divides the students into levels.
and the stuff that I learned from my parents and my family in general and just use it to enhance my kids' experience. It's all about making their experience better than yours.

So your pops It's like that tell a story differently.
I got a lot of families like that, they teach your life and show your life
it could be like a belt-like, you can latch it on to yourself like even. It's just the possibility like this is more functional than a pop socket
So they just keep on driving the car, the price is lower and they just make like how can you be retail and then also like the ability for the
and as long as we can just keep on buying it and profiting it, it's just gonna be there and that's you know
That's true. but yeah, that's another thing when friends don't budget correctly and then they're out there and your like I'm not giving you money.
