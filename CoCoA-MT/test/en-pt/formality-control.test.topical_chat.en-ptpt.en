I would probably be more in shape if I lived there. Wonder if anyone who lives there participates on the website for people to crash on your couch while they are traveling.
That would be epic! Plus you could melt snow out of your way if you live in that sort of climate.
I could see that. Especially with a sax leaning on your chin all the time!
I know. It was really nice chatting with you.
I was worried the Sun or smoke had voided the warranty on your computer
Yes, I actually haven't seen him in a movie since American Beauty. I watch movies on Netflix sometimes. Do you?
I guess the instrument would irritate your face over a long time period. Do you enjoy fantasy by any chance?
"Did you ever see her ""Cribs"" episode on MTV? She is super-extra!"
Which is your favorite film of of the original trilogy?
Hi do you like to wear shirts? I do! I wear them every day.
i do not. i cannot afford the gucci. but it sure looks cool. do you have the gucci?

It does sound familiar. Have you seen the movie Edward Scissorhands? Apparently Johnny Depp only says about 200 words
What? the drive thru? what exactly was going on at that high school of yours? Respect the drive thru! it was made for the troops!
Well that depends on the equipment you buy and also where you play.
Interesting. If you think about it, a lot of power comes from water.
lol I had an African grey that could say everything I said around the house. Like clean your room! as well any loud sounds.
yeah, that is pretty cool. What do you think about birds?
I didn't, but your comment about fish and sharks has me thinking about animals now. It's so weird that hiccups come from when land animals had gills AND lungs in early evolution!
no, not a big gamer, you? The u.s. department of defense used 1760 playstation 3's to build a supercomputer because it was cheaper than the alternative
On a different note, have you ever heard of K pop?
Yeah it would be. No, I don't really have a favorite, how about yourself?
Yeah, you should give it a try, I wonder what surprises will bring this years awards!
Really? That is crazy, I wonder who thought of even trying that. Well it was good talking with you, I hope you have a good night.
Oh I see, so whats is your favorite breakfast meal? I love omelets with a cup of coffee, just makes me start the day on a positive note
You know your Disney films! I enjoy animation, but usually the ones for adults, not kids.
Are there any artist that you would like to see live?
Is the sun blocking your internet signal tonight?
True! Do you ever Listen to Taylor Swift?
yeah, it is a silly look. nobody wants to see your drawers. Have a good night!
I guess so! What is your favorite kind of drama, is tv shows? I also think plays are pretty good too!
Really, I'm in Fla. we have our areas. But self driving is scary! Since you live in the cold, why would it be illegal to warm up your car in Ohio?
The Internets are rife with danger! You stay safe yourself, Dr. Leary! Do not fear the face-eating monkeys!
Yes he was. It was nice chatting with you as well. Have a nice night!!!
hey there what do you think of planet earth?
I wonder what attracts the players to the game. Perhaps it's the complexity, or maybe the chance to create your own personal style.
I saw the movie. It has Leonardo DiCaprio I think it was directed by Ridley Scott. I actually liked that movie a lot. did you see the movie Wonder Woman by the way
No I agree with you. Are you going to watch the Academy Awards by the way? They give out 24 Awards and I think that the first broadcast was back in 1930, which is wild
That is so cool! I'll have to look those up! I think I remember something about spiderman getting married. Do you?
ya I think he won a dancing championship actually! I guess martial arts are just dance moves used for defending yourself haha
That's cool. I like comedy movies and tv shows. Have you ever seen 3rd rock from the sun?
Well, its time to start cycling to work. Nice chatting with you.
Yeah thinking about how much both franchises are worth is pretty crazy. Speaking of Batman, who was your favorite actor to play him?
That is pretty cool. Do you like to bird watch?
I don't know know that much about it. Have you heard about the generic comic book?
for sure, I mean bringing your date to it! Almost as crazy as disney almost shutting down their studios because of sleeping beauty failing
Have you heard of this game? Astro Bot Rescue Mission' rekindles the fun gaming for even the most jaded
do you wear your boots to bed? i had a friend who did that. he was worried that someone would break into his house and he would have to fight them. he didnt want bare feet.
"I skim it, and look for key phrases like, ""Give u your soul"" and ""Organ harvesting"" etc. :)"
Yeah, that will do the trick. What about inception, have you seen it?
So, what's on your mind? What would you like to chat about? Perhaps government?
I feel bad for stray dogs sometimes. Istanbul has a vending machine that releases food and water for them if you recycle plastic bottles.
Yup. well it was nice chatting with you have a good day.
Good, yourself? do you listen to music?
by the way, do you watch movies with superhero? Who is your favorite?
Have you ever seen the white shark cafe? It's where white sharks meet in the middle of the Pacific Ocean.
Well, your dog can't help. I would the chips off the floor too! They're CHIPS. Can't go to waste.
You are correct about that. There's big money in test, treatments,and medications. Well, I know what I'm having for dinner now, either cajun stuffed flounder or blackened Mahi. What's your favorite fish to eat?
That would have been short sighted. Can you imagine making only $309? I would be so sad...
Wow, that is weird and sad. Speaking of which, did you hear about the tiger found in the duffel bag?
I could definitely see that. What were your favorite video games? Jane McGongiai was the game designer behind that study, pretty cool.
I don't be so hard on yourself. I'm a horrible Dancer too! What makes me happy is that Michael Jackson patented is extremely in dance move. It was like a device he made. That was definitely his move
he was a mechanical engineer, of course. Well, it's been nice chatting with you this morning. Hope you enjoy your Friday!
I never watch the show, do you think he would have done a better job?
Maybe the Harry Potter movies? I don't think the movie Blade Runner comes close to it haha. Have you seen it?
He must have really felt the calling to it. It was fun chatting about comedy with you, have a great day!
I agree. It's sad. I had a good time chatting with you tonight!
Yeah. That seems young. Nice chatting with you!
I don't either, I wonder if it triggers something in your brain. Kind of crazy. Do you have a favorite shirt?
I hope yours is going well, too. Baseball is generally played with a bat and ball.
I wonder if that person even shows up to vote, or why he's in the jungle like that haha. Did you vote last election?
Yeah and also, many people don't know there's really no correlation between connection quality and service bars either. To answer your question, I'm not sure. What does Minnie Mouse stand for?
Its either from 2017 or 2018. Netflix has it if you or anyone has access to it.
How is the weather in your area ?
Hmm. Do you hunt? Or are the deer protected in your area? There are lots of places that restrict such things.
Yeah, it seems that way, or maybe rotated at a bigger speed, you know we have an embassador in case aliens arrive to the planet or try to make contact with us.
Ahh that's definitely enough then. It's interesting how different areas have different cars and rules too. In Ohio it's illegal to warm up your car.
Ah didnt know. Nintendo owns the Seattle Mariners. I didn't know that, did you? That's nuts.
Its all I have to work from we prob have different stuff no biggie. Tell me more about your topic.
I do. Can you believe when Arnold Schwarzenegger was governor of CA he never lived in Sacramento, instead he commuted 3 hours every day by private jet.
Good Morning! Do you like to watch horror films?
wow. I never cared for her books, did you?
What did you think of the last couple elections?
It's probably super expensive to upload your mind to a computer, there probably won't be many fans left at the end of it all
LOL. Well, it wasn't designed for tourists! I guess you learned your lesson. Still, thanks for helping keep Istanbul clean!
I think I only saw that becuase my wife has a crush on him. I think he may have been shirtless on the trailer so my wife was all in on the movie. Did you like it?
I hear Stephen Fry's name all the time, he must be super famous in the UK. I don't, you going to spit some softball knowledge my way?
Thanks, enjoy your day, play some Gran Turismo and become famous!
Yeah I guess talent runs in the family. Do you now how many hours of video games we play in a week as a planet?
Are you familiar with Native American books?
That would be epic, especially in Finland... LOL I must of read your comment wrong.
Yeah, when you put it that way the least of your worries is your phone getting damaged but getting hit on the head and suffering from a brain injury.
Hes amazing, real funny! He thinks kung fu hustle is the supreme acchievement of modern age in terms of comedy. I dont know about that, it was a great movie, but not amazing lol what do you think?
I do know some like he worked at Bubba Gump. Nice chatting with you!
Hey there I'm doing great. What did you think about the Disney movie Frozen?
Yeah I am the same way, I haven't been for a few years but used to go all the time. What would you say is your favorite ever?

Interesting. Did you see that movie? I saw it.
I do. You yourself? And I believe that google is the largest search engine, although Youtube is owned by Google if I am not mistaken.
You can't escape your addiction at the top of Everest even. There is 3g cell service and Internet capabilities up there!

I would use a rocket launcher LOL just kidding. do you watch soccer at all? Apparently soccer makes more than all other sports combined
I don't know what you mean? There is a group called transhumanist's that want to upload their minds to computers and memory sticks!
Probably, make up can really transform you into almost anyone
Did not know that, pretty cool an actor as well. Nice chatting with you
Good Morning! Have you ever heard of K-Pop?
I hope not! Otherwise I am going there to stop it! They should do what boulder does and make it so you don't own pets but are their guardian
Oh ok, that makes sense! That's funny!! Have you heard of this K-pop? The North Korean played a song, Hit your heart when they sank a South Korean warship in 2010. Good thing they are getting along better now!!
That is really crazy! speaking of actors and actresses, what do you think about Leonardo DiCaprio? hes in some of my favorite movies like The Departed
Yeah, i understand! people want to carve out there own identity. Jazz is pretty big. you might find something in there to call your own.
Holy smokes I wouldn't be able to listen that fast! lol It's been fun chatting with you!
I think you have to know somebody. It sounds like it involves few duties. Mostly waiting.
So, what kinds of other entertainment would you have in your perfect day?

Yeah. Have you ever ridden in the jurassic park ride?
Oh, I listen to the news about them every now and then, but try not too get too carried away in celeb worship, you know? How about yourself?
I think it would be pretty cool. Do you play minecraft?
i agree with you. it happened several years ago. it says pro-trumpers found them and posted them to social media. that seems odd...
Do you listen to music at the gym? Do you bring your own music or listen to what the gym is already playing?
It is crazy how much people can determine from simply looking at your clothes. Like if your clothes gap in certain ways it shows you wear off the rack.
Maybe he should. What did you think about that guy findin 3 million dollars worth of old baseball cards in his grandpas attic.
Yep that's true. And yeah, making her the secretary would definitely not fly today haha. What do you think about Leonardo DiCaprio by the way? I really liked him in Titanic
Have you ever played the game yourself, I have not, I'm not originally from the US.
Yeah she was in it, I though she was pretty good, you should definitely watch it, great movie.
Stan lee is excellent writer also, he make the movie interesting. Which is your favourite sports ?

So true. Hey it's been great visiting with you. Have a great rest of your day! Don't eat eggs from a chef with no folds in his hat!!
Cat Woman! and you who is yours? If they had made Batman with Bill Murray ad Eddie Murphy I would expect to laugh. I just look at Bill Murray and he makes me laugh!
That was good. Nice chatting with you!
Oh I didn't know that. Have you seen that movie is it any good?
The same here. Try to make today your perfect day, however that is.
for sure, people made good money and the economy was great! Good chatting with you!
I did like her in Beauty and the Beast. Its on Netflix if you have access. Brings back memories of childhood
You mentioned that Tetris can help with addictions. Well it can also help with PTSD. So if you can deal with seeing Tetris shapes everywhere it might be a good option for PTSD.
Yeah, sometimes it feels like an endless pit. I read that when your kids go to college you should take all their paychecks. Lol, I would have gone nuts if my mom tried to take my checks like that.
Yea plus you can find yourself in trouble if you rely on google maps since they tailor disputed countries to the claims of each country depending on which country you are in
That is correct! produced by Walt Disney Animated Studios and released by Walt Disney Pictures. It was so cute! They also remade Rapunzel as Tangled, have you seen that?
I can't even imagine. Nice chatting with you!

No I didn't but that's neat! I don't think I asked, but what games do you or did you play?
I know, I haven't seen it. How lucky to find baseball cards in your grandfathers attic worth 3 million dollars! Good chat!!
They are not on FB yet. They are 7 and 5 so I have a few more years. I am not looking forward to those years. Are yours on social media?
Nice chatting with you! It is a perfect plan. we cannot fail.
I see your point it does look like a silly thing to do, do you like Tim Duncan, he is also another great player.
Good chatting with you too. Enjoy your clothing. I will enjoy mine.
Probably for the money lol that must be taxing on your body and mental health too, thats like a non stop party for 20 years ugh.
I agree, It was nice chatting with you as well. Have a great day!
Yea I just don't really see the point or appeal of a button down collar. Maybe to keep your tie in place, providing you were to wear a tie? I just don't really like the looks of it haha
No I didn't but I totally agree with you. I guess Dubai is in a desert region so they need a lot of water to keep the grass green but it still seems wrong just to play golf on it.
yes you're spot on. do you think his firing was fair since he had apologized before?
Wow, did you ever try any of the baseball games on playstation?
For sure lol, it was so nice talking with you, say hi to your cats for me!

WOw I want to try that actually. Unicef donated clean water when you don not use your hpone
I did not. I am glad McDonalds made a drive thru though. Can you imagine going in all the time to place your order?
You do have a point there. I've heard that AT teachers have great reputations so far. So your optimism may be justified haha.
I haven't heard of them until recently. I think it's a funny concept, to poke fun at some of Hollywood's worst productions, but I feel bad for the nominees! Have you seen them?
Yeah, the humble brag, the social comparisons, it is not good for your mind. better to go out and do things that you enjoy.
Hi there. Have you heard of the Razzie Awards? Seems to award the worst movies of the year!
Yes I agree with you! I watch YouTube almost everyday. I can't believe that Google bought YouTube for 1.65 billion dollars back in 2006. That seems like so long ago
That is insane! Oh judge Judy wonder what you do with all your money lol. Anyways, it's been good talking, I hope you have a good night!
I prefer melody and harmony. Who is your favorite artist?
i never realized how good dogs were at knowing what pointing is. but if you point, a dog will follow your finger. its great
