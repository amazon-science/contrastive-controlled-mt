So, Did you even realize that Comedy Central has cancelled over 100 shows since 1989??
Yeah it would be. No, I don't really have a favorite, how about yourself?

I skim it, and look for key phrases like, "Give u your soul" and "Organ harvesting" etc. :)
Hi, I love Disney movies!  I think Disney in general is great.  When you think about it being founded back in 1923 and it is still going strong, it's amazing.
lol, I agree with you!! I didn't know Nevada is the only state to have a none of the above voting option?
have you seen guardians of the galaxy?
I think thats a good idea, afterall you have to listen to your people, you know the like button is actually ilegal in a town of Germany!

Speaking of dancing, are you aware that Michael Jackson holds a patent on a dance device?
I have to say House of Cards or Better Call Saul, what about yours?

Yah, it's quite a bit larger than a baseball for sure, I've never seen a softball video game though, have you?
Have you ever seen Big hero 6?
True.   Then again, if you are recording on a houseboat like Pink Floyd, it doesn't much matter if your ship is going down!
Mackinac Island may not be for your gnome then. They have no cars, which is inconvenient for lazy gnomes!
I have never heard that fact, very odd. Do you use an iphone yourself?

Any object! So yes lol....must have been interesting!! As funny as if you grunt...before a shot...it is by some considered to be cheating!
That is kind of cool. Speaking of cool, do you think Ugg boots are cool? They were invented by surfers to keep their feet warm after getting out of the water.
I guess New Zealand would be ideal for you, with no snakes and all
I wonder what that entails. Speaking of aggressive, you can legally equip your car with flamethrowers in South Africa to prevent carjacking. Crazy!
Who was your favorite nemesis in Superman? I loved lex luther
Hi there. Do you like to play video games?
Ha, maybe you should. Officials in Athens didn't have much faith in elections. They thought it would lead to oligarchy.
Yes, I wouldn't be able to function without a car. I don't live close to anything and have to drive everywhere. How about yourself.

Yeah me neither, what did you think about Katy Perry and her wings?
Yeah, Hey listen to this it's illegal in south africa to equip a flame-thrower to your car to prevent carjacking.
he had notoriety to launch a campaign. if you are rich, famous, tall, etc you can run for govt. i figure the future is all about marketing, not content.

Hi! So do you like music? I love rock music and well many other genre's.
ya I do think they have a lot of power at present, I don't know that I want them expanding out much further, they control a lot of information, do you do any reading in your spare time?
That is intriguing. Edgar Allen Poe wrote the oldest known example of a cyborg in fiction. Did you hear that?
Dark Knight also.  I think Christian Bale is my favorite Batman.  Who's your favorite?
Haha that is super creative. Do you ever read movie reviews?
That was good. I heard of him. On another topic, do you use your cell phone a lot?
Those pucks look dangerous flying around.  I understand that most other countries understand hockey to mean field hockey.  I guess it depend on if your country is cold or not.
No. I hate snakes. I mean irrational hate! Do you?
Yep, the key is doing things that you can incorporate into a life long habit. DOn't compare your progress to others.
I enjoyed chatting with you as well! And yes I'll go to local pet store and see if they have elephants in stock haha

That guy was everywhere. Did you ever watch wall-e?
I will, I now have to look both up and down! Enjoy your day!
It seems that way. I've heard that it's illegal to "own" pets in Boulder, Colorado, but you can be their "guardian." Does that mean you can claim them on your taxes?
That is an honor. Would Miami be your team being from Florida? They had some glory years not that long ago.
Where do you source your news? Fox, Cnn, other?
No I do think that's true on another movies note, why did you think of Jurassic world Fallen Kingdom? I thought it was horrible
Wow, did you ever try any of the baseball games on playstation?
That's true, too! Well, nice chatting with you, enjoy your day.
yes, you want to connect to the operator so they can hear you gasping your last breaths. LOL.

That is too bad. DO you like Drake?
Hey there I love horses. Even though I'm allergic to them they are still very fun to ride, what do you think

I haven't seen it, but I'll take your word for it.
If you got it why not? He is worth over 20 billion dollars after all.
I find it sad that this was not done until 2013. Don't you think it should have been earlier than that?
hmm that seems dumb like its just playing with words, do you like Teddy Roosevelt? apparently he had over 20 pets, or as they say in Colorado, "Guardians" haha
Yeah I haven't seen those movies but I heard they were just awful. Another hilariously bad movie is called Rubber, it's a horror movie. Have you seen or heard of it? It deserves a Razzie for sure.
Yep I agree it seems stupid. I don't know why they need to play on grass specifically, did you hear about the longest tennis point of all time?
Yeah I get your point, well there is a website for low budget travelers, it great if you dont mind sleeping on a couch,
What is your favorite thing about Amazon? Mine is the shopping site, I can pretty much find anything!
yikes, I don't think that name would go over so well in the USA lol. It was so nice chatting with you, enjoy your day!
Yes! That is it, but it seemed like you were on a crazy ride lol. That franchise is worth 3 billion dollars that's pretty amazing for older movies.
i never realized how good dogs were at knowing what pointing is. but if you point, a dog will follow your finger. its great
Thank goodness, indeed. I agree with you, though, there is still progress to be made, and I think reading diverse fiction and poetry can help people see things from other perspectives.
I used to play video games. Not much now. Lost interest. Do you?
Do you collect anything? I like to collect hats.
yes, but in bad neighborhoods sometimes people break into your place and you might need to confront them. you want your shoes on then. clothing would be good too.
Are you interested in dogs? They are quite clever. Dogs can learn over a thousand words and reason better than chimps.
The Republican Party is really popular in the states do you agree?
Can you imagine looking out your hotel window in Las Vegas and seeing that 50ft robot roaming around!! ha, ha ha!!
Good morning. Just wondering, would you consider lots of healthy eating as being part of your perfect day?
Intriguing. Did you hear about the judge in Michigan who delivered a ruling againt him? She delivered it by rapping when she ruled.
That is insane! Oh judge Judy wonder what you do with all your money lol. Anyways, it's been good talking, I hope you have a good night!
No but Im sure they are doing just fine without your revenue. Silence of the Lamb came out on valentines day? Seems odd.
Enjoy it, I will have to check the news out to see it. Enjoy your weekend also!
What do you think of Serena Williams?
Someone stole your gnome? Who steals a gnome? Was it the travelocity gnome looking for a friend?

Probably a lot more than 55,000. Ha! Did you ever see Wall-E? If so, the name is actually a tip of the hat to Walter Elias Disney himself!
Hey how is it going, you ever cook a turkey during Thanksgiving?
Yeah you would think drinking salty water through your mouth would taste bad lol
Yeah me too. On another topics, do you have much interest in science?
That would be scary. When you turn 100 in Japan, the PM sends you a silver cup to celebrate.
Interesting! What kind of dogs do you like?
I am well. I used to play video games but gave them up when I got married. Do you??
I agree, It was nice chatting with you as well. Have a great day!
Lets talk about Children's Literature next. The government in Norway will buy 1000 copies of your book that you publish in Norway to distribute to libraries, 1500 if its a children's book.
Wow, that is a long time to take to write a script. Well, nice chatting with you!
You too! Have a good night! Enjoy your nintendo!
I think the republicans will win. Do you think someone will run against Trump on the republican ballot next time?
I'm doing well today, how about yourself?
Oh wow, definitely not! Anyways, I am going to get going, great chatting with you, take care and have a great night!
I think the movie tried to have an overall good message to be the best you can be in everything you do. Inspirational for many.
Also amazing, i love those shows about ocean life, theres a whole way of life down there, do you ever watch Blue Planet? Whats your favorite water animal? I love Orcas and Octopus
I would do exactly the same as you. How could you not pass that up the chance to set yourself up for life? lol
Yes they do!  have you watched any movies created by Disney?  Bill Nye was a science consultant for the movie Flubber.
i agree with you. it happened several years ago. it says pro-trumpers found them and posted them to social media. that seems odd...
I read them sometimes, I mostly rely on Rotten Tomatoes, and you?
I think I would have to say Marvel, I grew up watching shows and reading those comics. How about yourself?
You sound like me! I have been to so many concerts and have bought so much music over the years. I have  alot to refer back to. Do you have favorite bands?
Yeah. In Kentucky, you can't take office if you've ever participated in a duel. Maybe that's what we need more of in politics today -- duels.
Sorry I didn't see your question about fish, btw. I've tried to keep goldfish as pets several times over the years. I had a pet corn snake once too. How big was your python?
Yeah and also, many people don't know there's really no correlation between connection quality and service bars either. To answer your question, I'm not sure. What does Minnie Mouse stand for?
I think I have read that before as well, I think it would be so wild to see your manager take an at bat!
Well, its time to start cycling to work. Nice chatting with you.
I didn't know that, would you call that a "copy cat?" haha
Do you like Legos? did you ever play with them as a child or even later?
I don't know what you mean? There is a group called transhumanist's that want to upload their minds to computers and memory sticks!
Yeah, when you put it that way the least of your worries is your phone getting damaged but getting hit on the head and suffering from a brain injury.
I am with you there, what is your favorite movie?
What can't dogs do! I know they aren't color blind like we were taught when young. It was so nice chatting with you, tell yuki hi!
