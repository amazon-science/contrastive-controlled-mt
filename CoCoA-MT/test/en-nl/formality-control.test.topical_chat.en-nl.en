Yep I can see that perspective. I always thought that it was always red and blue but apparently that started in the year 2000. What were your thoughts on Harry Truman?
I wonder how Unicef would even know if you were using your cell phone or not

I have. I heard that he started a library in 1895 with 32,000 books in it. All from his personal collection. Can you imagine?
Yeah, when you put it that way the least of your worries is your phone getting damaged but getting hit on the head and suffering from a brain injury.
Might as well take a risk. Lebron is looking good this season. He's so focused. Whose your favorite player?
I know what you mean. It is the only object known to have life and we need to know why that is.
He would be steamed and I would be totally embarrassed. Lol. Did you ever play soccer baseball. That's what Canadians call kickball.

Hope your better than traveling with Billy Mays. Pallbearers with blue shirts and khaki pants.
I think that in this day and age, you need to capture the younger viewer to make your medium longer lasting. They may not relate to the same jokes that have sustained the comic industry for so long.
That is pretty cool. Do you like to bird watch?
That would be epic! Plus you could melt snow out of your way if you live in that sort of climate.
Well, your dog can't help. I would the chips off the floor too! They're CHIPS. Can't go to waste.
That was good. Nice chatting with you!
I don't know what you mean? There is a group called transhumanist's that want to upload their minds to computers and memory sticks!
I did, but I rather watch the games than to play them on a video game console, do you like baseball?
"Me too! Best of luck to you and your ""Amazon Family!"" Take care."
Agreed. Do you plan to see the latest installment: M. I - Fallout?

Nice! Did you see the first movie when it came out in 1977? I remember going to the theater to see it.

wow, talk about ruining it for your team! Was he a yankee at the time or a red sox, I can't remember
Hmm I am not sure, How do you even calculate that to be honest?
At times, your near power lines. It is unavoidable in modern life. I would not stay under them for a long time. A bike trail under them would not appeal to me.
Yeah I could see that being possible. Do you have any Apple Computers by the way? Apparently if you smoke by them, Apple says that it creates a biohazard and they won't fix your computer
Yeah, I did. The movie isn't bad either. Well, nice chatting with you!
That's true with Walmart. But with Prime you get music and videos free. Books too for your Kindle. I stream videos, so this is a good benefit. I shop other places occasionally-like Etsy for gifts.

I agree with you. It was so nice chatting with you!
I took a horse ride once and live in an area with lots of horses. They are beautiful animals. you?

Have you ever been on a blind date?
Wow that is crazy long. Well it was nice chatting with you. Have a good day.
That's really nice of him! What a nice guy, why do you think Greenland can't join FIFA? Apparently it's because they can't grow green grass LOL

Yeah I am the same way, I haven't been for a few years but used to go all the time. What would you say is your favorite ever?
Sometimes it worth the wait. Usually when sequels are rushed they are so disappointing. Still, it's a whole lot better than getting your entertainment from chickens like the British did on the time of Caesar.

I was worried the Sun or smoke had voided the warranty on your computer

Did you watch the movie? Was it really a space movie?
I think you have to know somebody. It sounds like it involves few duties. Mostly waiting.
true, by the time you see your answer you have moved on
I would go to comic con, San Diego sounds warm. In sweden it is illegal to name your child metallica.
Yeah, and most places you travel you can still access your account since it's available in countries except for China, Syria, North Korea and Crimea.
That is insane. Do you watch the Academy Awards?
The same here. Try to make today your perfect day, however that is.
you get to wear panda costumes while working with them!
Can you imagine being falsely imprisoned for 10 years and spend most of the time at a library trying to prove your Innocence?

Yeah, that will do the trick. What about inception, have you seen it?
That sucks. So the ball pythons when they are with their owner will roll up into a ball the size of your palm. So I could just put him in my pocket.
Yea plus you can find yourself in trouble if you rely on google maps since they tailor disputed countries to the claims of each country depending on which country you are in
You mentioned that Tetris can help with addictions. Well it can also help with PTSD. So if you can deal with seeing Tetris shapes everywhere it might be a good option for PTSD.
I think having something run that long would be a neat accomplishment, something that you create to exist long past your time.
It is really nice of him. What do you think about Glenn Howerton? He actually was the star of Always Sunny in Philadelphia and he almost got the lead in Jurassic World
The train is moving. you are moving. you are moving at the same speed. if you jump up, your speed does not change. if it turns and you dont, then you will slam into the wall.

That is really crazy! What are some of your favorite animals by the way? I know that I really like dogs.
Me too! Did you see Bill Murray's Kung Fu Hustle?
Oh wow that's very cool! Hey at least if you ever want to pick up a new show after, Nat Geo Wild has a show that parodies Game of Thrones but follows lions!
He must have really felt the calling to it. It was fun chatting about comedy with you, have a great day!
Not a ton... I love sports though so I could get into it if I needed to. Do you like any other sports?
I hope yours is going well, too. Baseball is generally played with a bat and ball.
How's it going? Do you like sports?
That is true. Did you hear about that time in 1957 when Truman refused to be photographed with Dumbo
I know, and when you think about it it doesnt take much time just have to incorporate them as habits in your routine.
We have a nicer car, now, and it's so pleasant to go places and not worry about if your vehicle looks good enough. I also enjoy the more comfortable ride...and the heated seats are amazing!
She loves you, Yeah, yeah, yeah! Only because we played it while I was in Junior High band and we thought we were cool!
Really, I'm in Fla. we have our areas. But self driving is scary! Since you live in the cold, why would it be illegal to warm up your car in Ohio?
I kind of like the idea of being able to upload your mind to a computer and memory sticks because you would be leaving some kind of legacy behind after you're gone.
Yes, I will wait for Elon to travel on it first though before I go. Talk to you soon!
That is a very large number. I wonder how many are in south africa. That country has it legal to put flame throwers on your car to prevent carjackings.

I agree! What are your views on the Golden State Warriors?
Good question! They also owe IGN the gaming website. Do you game?
No I didn't but I totally agree with you. I guess Dubai is in a desert region so they need a lot of water to keep the grass green but it still seems wrong just to play golf on it.
