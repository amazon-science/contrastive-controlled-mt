I think the movie tried to have an overall good message to be the best you can be in everything you do. Inspirational for many.
Yes and all you have to do is feed it plastic bottles
I think that in this day and age, you need to capture the younger viewer to make your medium longer lasting. They may not relate to the same jokes that have sustained the comic industry for so long.

I skim it, and look for key phrases like, "Give u your soul" and "Organ harvesting" etc. :)

That is kind of cool. Speaking of cool, do you think Ugg boots are cool? They were invented by surfers to keep their feet warm after getting out of the water.
They are good for your health as well, guess why?

Is her name Anne Jones ? If yes you could put a generator on your books and sell the electricity. Do you enjoy reading ?

That is a bit invasive, they can track your location and all, your cellphone can get hacked and then a stalker will know your every move
I did not know that. So if comics are not are thing, where to do get your entertainment from?
I could definitely see that. What were your favorite video games? Jane McGongiai was the game designer behind that study, pretty cool.
I love the original 3 like you. But the new ones are bad, I agree.
I think it would be pretty cool. Do you play minecraft?
You would still have rights in Germany though, no matter what holdovers from your ancestors.  Under the 1912 Scottish Protection of Animals Act, the Loch Ness monster is a protected species.
That is too bad. DO you like Drake?
What do you think about the United Nations appointing an ambassador to extraterrestrials? I wonder what he does all day, sounds like the most boring job in the world because obviously we haven't had contact yet

I will, I now have to look both up and down! Enjoy your day!
It seems that way. I've heard that it's illegal to "own" pets in Boulder, Colorado, but you can be their "guardian." Does that mean you can claim them on your taxes?
Well that depends on the equipment you buy and also where you play.
No I do think that's true on another movies note, why did you think of Jurassic world Fallen Kingdom? I thought it was horrible
I agree! What are your views on the Golden State Warriors?
What games do you play on the switch?
Yeah that is true. Do you use your phone much?

thanks! Hopefully you don't grow a white patch on your forehead if you ever get domesticated!
The Internets are rife with danger! You stay safe yourself, Dr. Leary! Do not fear the face-eating monkeys!

interesting. There is a UNICEF program that donates clean water for every minute you do not use your phone.
Good morning. How are your investments today?
I haven't seen it, but I'll take your word for it.
I can see him but Tupac? I guess Tupac danced ballet in high school. How can you hide a gun in tights?
yeah, that is pretty cool. What do you think about birds?
I find it sad that this was not done until 2013. Don't you think it should have been earlier than that?
Are you familiar with Native American books?
In Boulder, Colorado you cannot own a pet. You can be their guardian though.
Ha, that or have a heart attack, no seriously, you burn 180 calories watching a horror movie, wonder what other types of cinema burn?

Thank goodness, indeed. I agree with you, though, there is still progress to be made, and I think reading diverse fiction and poetry can help people see things from other perspectives.
Yes, Aren't they interesting! Do you have a favorite planet? I think mine would be Jupiter and Venus!!
Do you collect anything? I like to collect hats.
Wow, that's awesome! Who is your favorite Baseball team? I like my Az team lol
I do not think $7500 is a lot of money to provide Darth Vader's voice because the movie was very successful. What do you think?
That is amazing, great actor! good chatting with you!
Probably for the money lol that must be taxing on your body and mental health too, thats like a non stop party for 20 years ugh.
Ahh that's definitely enough then. It's interesting how different areas have different cars and rules too. In Ohio it's illegal to warm up your car.
Good morning, yes I do. How about yourself?
Kids' movies are big money for celebrities now. What is your favorite kids' movie?
I thought it was great too! It really surprised me that it was so good!  It's also impressive about that super computer don't you think?
I think I have read that before as well, I think it would be so wild to see your manager take an at bat!
Yeah, Hey listen to this it's illegal in south africa to equip a flame-thrower to your car to prevent carjacking.
Have you ever seen the white shark cafe? It's where white sharks meet in the middle of the Pacific Ocean.
ha nope not at all, would you ever upload your brain to a usb drive if you could?
Wow great information, I will have to try that sometime. Do you like to eat fish or even go fishing?
Another great idea! You could let your imagination turn fantasy into reality hahaaa.....there is actually a University to go and study fantasy...you could learn all you could imagine lol!!
Yeah me too. On another topics, do you have much interest in science?
That would be scary. When you turn 100 in Japan, the PM sends you a silver cup to celebrate.
Interesting! What kind of dogs do you like?
I am well. I used to play video games but gave them up when I got married. Do you??
I don't either, I wonder if it triggers something in your brain. Kind of crazy. Do you have a favorite shirt?
I played a bit. I warn't into them games. I had other chores to attend to on the farm/prison where I growed up. You? Did you play them games?
Wow, that is a long time to take to write a script. Well, nice chatting with you!
You too! Have a good night! Enjoy your nintendo!
How is the weather in your area ?
I'm not sure if it's the same guy, I don't know Top Gear personally, but it could be, do you ever play softball by the way or watch it on TV?
Yep I agree it seems stupid. I don't know why they need to play on grass specifically, did you hear about the longest tennis point of all time?
I guess so! What is your favorite kind of drama, is tv shows? I also think plays are pretty good too!
Also amazing, i love those shows about ocean life, theres a whole way of life down there, do you ever watch Blue Planet? Whats your favorite water animal? I love Orcas and Octopus
Yes they do, tipping your hat origin is from when a knight raises their visors.
Yes they do!  have you watched any movies created by Disney?  Bill Nye was a science consultant for the movie Flubber.
i agree with you. it happened several years ago. it says pro-trumpers found them and posted them to social media. that seems odd...
Probably pretty scary, apparently you can burn more than 180 calories watching a horror movie
Yes, that is very cool. maybe your dogs could be donors. i hope that the dogs at the drives get lots of treats.
Well you might could go out to a comedy film with your date - bromantic comedies like Harold and Kumar could be good for date night
You sound like me! I have been to so many concerts and have bought so much music over the years. I have  alot to refer back to. Do you have favorite bands?
Yeah. In Kentucky, you can't take office if you've ever participated in a duel. Maybe that's what we need more of in politics today -- duels.
wow but you know that the most important things about clothing is that it protects your body from weather conditions
Yeah and also, many people don't know there's really no correlation between connection quality and service bars either. To answer your question, I'm not sure. What does Minnie Mouse stand for?
Wow, did you ever try any of the baseball games on playstation?
for sure, I mean bringing your date to it! Almost as crazy as disney almost shutting down their studios because of sleeping beauty failing
wow. I never cared for her books, did you?
Do you like Legos? did you ever play with them as a child or even later?
Yes, that is genius! Just enjoy yourself and try to share something together. Maybe somewhere outdoors.
