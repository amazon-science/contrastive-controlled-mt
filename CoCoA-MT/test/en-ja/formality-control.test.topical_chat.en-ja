Haha well they call it soccer-baseball, a very dumb name in my opinion LOL
Same with me.  I must have been 11 or so.  Nintendo is valued at over $85 billion
I've never heard that. Those types of coincidences are always interesting to me.
Yeah, soon amazon will own everything and we will all work at amazon. 15 miles a day. can i do that at my age? LOL
Yeah. I just had my son next to me at my desk doing math homework. I hope I set a good example, at least...
Exactly. That's why I watch both CNN and Fox. It kind of helps me to sort through the muck.
Have you ever player Hockey?  I'm not good on skates so it never tempted me, I'd be dangerous with a hockey stick in my hand.
I dont I have about 6 paris myself, I bet ballet dancers do
Yeah me too! I love Frozen though.
Really, me either. I have a bad memory for some things. lol, but I think I will never forget that Minnie Mouse's name is really Minerva.
Wow that is crazy that's a lot of calories to burn in a day! I'm just glad that Amazon has an exclusive contract with USPS to deliver on Sundays, that makes me happy
Yeah! No Bruno's band is called the hooligans. You think since he writes his own music he could have come up with a better name but maybe it's just me.
me too I love dogs so much. Elephants and dogs are the only animals that respond to pointing
Well let me get back to my facebook account and see who posted what.
That is crazy! my computer has a lot more juice than that, unbelievable how tech advances.
Probably fighting unfortunately. Doesn't sound very fun. What is fun is my old NES. I recently busted it out and the thing still works!
I have dogs and used to have cats too but dogs are my favorite.
That is so funny I guess I never considered a seahorse a fish. The black swallower fish sounds a lot like a snake because it can eat pray that is so large.
i have no idea. millions? you got me. some tech billionaire will want the thing and pay a ton.
I like some of their stuff. A few things are a bit underhandedly political for my taste but most is good. You?
Yes, I love it just because it reminds me of my childhood. That is how we lived in that time. Lots of imagination and kids taking off in groups having adventures.
Yes, so delightful and treasured. Mine will mimic things that make me run looking for alarms sometimes.lol
Nice I enjoy watching the world series, my favorite team is the Red Sox, they won it this year!
I bet. i was never interested myself. seemed very violent.
Yes, my animals have those patches. I think it's all the head pats.
That is amazing, 2430 games every year that is just too many numbers for me
They really love their pets huh? No, I don't have any pets. Do you?
Without looking it up, my guess is that Qatar is building a city to host it. Which would be pretty amazing. How about Wonder Woman? Did  you see it? What did you think?
Aha!  I was just racking my brain about EM in that movie!  And now I need to figure out who his wife is!!!
Maybe she's just really small and wanted to seem bigger and more powerfull than she really is. As a 6'6" male, fashion does not come in my size so I don't even worry about it.
Yes they basically made my whole childhood
Yeah, I play a little bit when I was a child but it was not for me, my fingers are short lol.
Oh really, have you heard of the arrow shirt collar? Those were my favorite shirts in my teens.
We had met each other a few times before our actual first date, but my husband took me to go snowboarding and an all you can eat sushi place, I love sushi!
that show wasn't my cup of tea, but I enjoy him when hes on Shark Tank
That sounds like drowning to me! I like that Cornell University makes students pass a basic swim test.  Imagine being best in class and then failing because you can't swim.
LOL I like the way you think. it is crazy though that Amazon owns imdb.com, I use that almost everyday for my movie collection
I like my older Android as well. The prices are too high for me. It has been great chatting!!! Have a great night!! :)
That's pretty crazy. I guess now that I think about it, no other fish do have necks! The oldest goldfish lived until 43. I think mine lived a year.
I think my first nintendon was in mid 80s
that must have taken him quite a while. 224 words, backwards and forwards? my head hurts.
I use it only to make my grocery list! What voice do you use for yours?
im sure, i got my cable disconnected and subscribed to both nextflix and Hulu
that would make sense to me. i guess they need a speedy link to send and receive data. do you believe in extraterrestrials?
You have a good poino video games now (toars Patagonia, so I'm not too worried.
I will have to, yes, his name is rocky, he is my favorite pet of all time, what is your dogs name?
Yeah, I don't remember that at all. He definitely doesn't seem like the type.
I know they need to apply those genes to me! also weird is there is no fish except for the seahorse that has an actual neck
ah yup, all my friends have iphones, but my brother and I are the holdouts with android, theyre just way better with more customizations imo
Yeah, my kids are always watching some Disney movie.  My daughter loves the live action Beauty and the Beast.
Yeah, me too. I like baseball a lot, I played when I was younger.
Not bad.  I see hockey on my list but not that story.  A hockey players was traded for only 1 dollar in 1993 and went on to win 4 stanley cups.  I don't know his name though.
I can believe that. My son watches movies all the time along with TV shows and Netflick originals. He got me hooked on Stranger Things.
It seems a stretch to call it a WWI movie, in  my opinion. I would think a WWI movie would show more soldiers in battle rather than a fictitious superhero movie.
Very smart... hada step son that i tried to implement that on... but his mother never supported me... he would sometimes play for 18 hours straight!
That seems very odd to me. Thinking back to the Sonic games they do not have music that I would have thought a high profile musician made.
Some of my friends say their bill is like $20 per month or less!  I live in an apartment.  yeah thats insanely huge!
I think it's fun to read sometimes. The origins are more interesting for me. Early poems in the Eurasian content evolved from folksongs.
I prefer the original 3 from my childhood in the 70's. Hopefully they learn something from their flops like Treasure planet, not that was a waste of money.
Exactly, well said! I don't want to see grown men spitting water on my 70 inch tv, yuck! That isn't even comedy to me. Its just poor taste and manners.
Yeah, but my guppies are a pain in the neck sometimes...but so am I. But at least I, like most humans, can regrow a surgically-removed rib in about 2-3 months. So, I got that going for me!
I know, really? How about our hiccups are from gills and lungs?
Snakes too, it reminds me of that movie a few years back, Snakes on a Plane.  Maybe I could take my service elephant on my next flight.
I would like to know his secret! Maybe not immortal but give me until 125...
Okay you've got me there, who's Eeyore.
i wish i had. those guys were always touring. i missed my chance.
Oh really? What an awesome fact! I know that when I was a baby, I would spontaneously dance (that's what my parents said). It's crazy how natural dancing is!
Yes, he cracks me up! I like that he refuses to play bad guys in the movies he chooses.
Can you relax with your shoes? John Candy couldn't. he had to take them off. boy his dogs were barking! I usually wear shoes myself.
Absolutely not. News is often depressing, and I could stand without it. Now, toss on a piano song, or music....now you've got me. Though I hate classical music. Well, most of it.
Yes! my older daughter introduced me to them, they are obsessed with K pop and BTS (a boy band in case u havent heard) their songs are catchy
oh yeah? I remember my parents getting pong... LOL
Nice! Stanford's free artificial intelligence class uses Google plus hangouts to help them teach more effectively. What do you think of AI? It kind of scares me. lol
Was it a sheep? I heard the first cloned pet was a cat, though. Its name was copy cat. That is funny!
Hey there my friend do you ever wear shoes.
News to me!  If it gets made into a film, I hope it does not flop at the box office like Disney's Treasure Planet!
Oh yeah I guess so ha ha. There's even a town in Alaska that has a mayor cat.
oh good for them :) my daughter when she was like 1, she was always falling asleep to Metallica ;) it was her lullaby :)
Noway, I was hugging something at 2 months and it wasn't a racket. That is crazy! It reminds me of a Katy Perry song.
Have you heard of these transhumanists who want to load themselves on to memory sticks? My kids keep taking my sticks, I'd hate to be overwritten by some school project.
me either! Nintendo released a handheld console specifically for pokemon in 2001.
that's the other reason that I need the immortal jellyfish genes inside me, so I can eat my weight in pizza everyday and not die prematurely haha
Yeah you would think it's been a lot longer than that. At least to my relocation.
No he wasn't. I like Salvador Dali a lot though he was born on my birthday haha. Have you ever seen a"Hidden Mickey"in any of the movies, I guess there's a subculture that looks for those in the movies
I agree. Seems odd that Cruise, who has won a Golden Globe Award, never won an Oscar for best actor. He's starred in so many films!
I wonder if they had met what he would have written about her.
I use mine somewhat, but not like some people I know. Interesting smoking near apple computers voids the warranty by making it a biohazard!
Neither did I. That is insane because Tupac was a famous rapper.
I am allergic to shellfish...maybe that is it. But can you believe this... I named my son Fisher. So there is a little love there!
She does have dragons, she's just indestructible which I find kind of silly haha. But I know that's just me. It's interesting that the person that plays the mountain is only 25 years old! He definitely looks a lot older
Oh sure, I guess Bender from futurama and the terminator both have the same cpu.
No, but we have a big distribution center in my city and I have been there. Can you believe Jeff Bezos built a clock into a mountain that should run for 10,000 years?
Too fast for me. Do you like rap ? I love Tupac
Based on my knowledge, I know that he sings with a sparkling outfit with a nice grand piano.
That kind of sounds a little bit insane to me to ber honest.
Well said! I think it suits me well too haha. That is where the conical party hat was derived from!
I don't even know the rules for soccer.  It's all the same.  My 12 year old son used to routinely beat me at everything.
I think they are a very good company also. Their animation keeps me pretty entertained.
I remember wanting the trendier clothes my friends wore, and once or twice getting made fun of for wearing hand me downs.
Impressive! Frozen was a very good movie in my opinion.
Yeah. In Kentucky, you can't take office if you've ever participated in a duel. Maybe that's what we need more of in politics today -- duels.
Hi, I love Disney movies!  I think Disney in general is great.  When you think about it being founded back in 1923 and it is still going strong, it's amazing.
Ah cool!  You should go more often then lol Did you see the most recent Beauty and the Beast?
Hey there I love horses. Even though I'm allergic to them they are still very fun to ride, what do you think
I know what you mean. It is the only object known to have life and we need to know why that is.
Who was your favorite nemesis in Superman? I loved lex luther
I guess so! What is your favorite kind of drama, is tv shows? I also think plays are pretty good too!
Did you watch the movie? Was it really a space movie?
Yeah, when you put it that way the least of your worries is your phone getting damaged but getting hit on the head and suffering from a brain injury.
That was good. Nice chatting with you!
I love watching it, which is your favorite team?
I think my favorite album is Bryce Vine. How about yourself?
when the earth was first formed a day was only 5.5 hours long. It was nice chatting with you, have a good night.
On a different note, have you ever heard of K pop?
That is correct! produced by Walt Disney Animated Studios and released by Walt Disney Pictures. It was so cute! They also remade Rapunzel as Tangled, have you seen that?
Yep I can see that perspective. I always thought that it was always red and blue but apparently that started in the year 2000. What were your thoughts on Harry Truman?
Just a random note, did you realize that Bruce Lee wa such a good dancer?
Where do you source your news? Fox, Cnn, other?
What? the drive thru? what exactly was going on at that high school of yours? Respect the drive thru! it was made for the troops!
Yes, I will wait for Elon to travel on it first though before I go. Talk to you soon!
I agree. What are your thoughts on people voicing their religious or political opinions if they don't know what yours are?
Another great idea! You could let your imagination turn fantasy into reality hahaaa.....there is actually a University to go and study fantasy...you could learn all you could imagine lol!!
How is the weather in your area ?
Nice chatting with you! It is a perfect plan. we cannot fail.
Would you see the Silence of the Lambs on Valentine's day? That's the day it came out in 1991. It made over $270 million in box office.
I enjoy music and dance. What is your favorite video game?
Yes, I wouldn't be able to function without a car. I don't live close to anything and have to drive everywhere. How about yourself.
Yes, and dogs can donate blood to other dogs. Do your Huskies resemble wolves in any way - to you?
I watch a lot of comedy stuff, How i met your mother, friends, the good place, the santa clarita diet, stuff like that, easy stuff. I do like a lot of drama though, like westworld, the handmaids tale etc.
Have you had to face any racism regarding your physical characteristics in your life? I have not had to, I am thankful for the jobs that I have had that I've worked in many environments as the minority race.
Siri isn't even compatible with Spotify on the Homepod. When your assistant can't talk to your music to play on your speakers, there's a problem!
So, Did you even realize that Comedy Central has cancelled over 100 shows since 1989??
I do. You yourself? And I believe that google is the largest search engine, although Youtube is owned by Google if I am not mistaken.
lol weird.  Been great chatting with you!
I bet you could. show off to your fellow geeks and programmers! classic style! anyway, great chat!
I know. It was really nice chatting with you.
I can't even imagine working that hard for a role and not getting it! I did watch Ironman all the way thru. How bout you?
I see your point it does look like a silly thing to do, do you like Tim Duncan, he is also another great player.
wow so crazy, now he showed them why he should have passed! Enjoy your day!
Yeah same here, I like to be able to at least play every sport just a bit once. Do you follow tennis at all?
I've heard of these cocktail places that do drinks using liquid nitrogen, you're meant to let it evaporate before ingesting. I can imagine when you've had a few drinks your sense of caution get lost.
Nice, that is cool. Do you like dogs?
Good morning. How are your investments today?
If you got it why not? He is worth over 20 billion dollars after all.
Yah, it's quite a bit larger than a baseball for sure, I've never seen a softball video game though, have you?
Nice! Did you see the first movie when it came out in 1977? I remember going to the theater to see it.
So what would be your team, which jersey would you want for a tweet?
When you buy a product, you get something in return. If you do not buy something, like facebook, youare the product. They are selling you to others through your data or ads.
That is too bad. DO you like Drake?
I did and loved it so much, and you?
that is a great idea! get your friends to tweet too! Have a good day!
I like both. I feel like they go somewhat hand in hand. There's nothing like going down the road windows down, blaring your favorite song.
I haven't heard of them until recently. I think it's a funny concept, to poke fun at some of Hollywood's worst productions, but I feel bad for the nominees! Have you seen them?
True.   Then again, if you are recording on a houseboat like Pink Floyd, it doesn't much matter if your ship is going down!
I'll be joining you!  Crocodiles are more closely related to birds than they are to snakes and lizards.  Odd fact.
exactly. pretend you need to ride away from the horror. LOL So, do you like the internet? or is it the bane of your existence?
Hi there, do you enjoy watching movies?
Lol, well it's been nice chatting with you this lovely, fine Florida afternoon.  I got to go wash my cat, if you know what I mean, I'll talk to you later, friend.
Is the sun blocking your internet signal tonight?
Wow that is really fast, I bet you can get to your destination in no time, do you like to travel?
Lol, good luck getting that to work. Maybe throw up a huge speaker into space and blast your sound from there.
Yes it is. Mostly by oceans but also lakes, rivers, and other sources! Well it was lovely getting to talk with you!
it's a funny thing.  i used to read a lot but these days i spend more time listening to music but i have been thinking about getting back into the reading.  who are some of your fav authors?
Wow great information, I will have to try that sometime. Do you like to eat fish or even go fishing?
I loved to play Pokemon, did you ever played the game or watched the series?
I will have to check that out lol! It was so nice chatting with you, enjoy your weekend!
That is a bit invasive, they can track your location and all, your cellphone can get hacked and then a stalker will know your every move
There you go! Send that idea to them! Especially since all these consoles are made in China! Might be a secret plan!
Would you steal a garden gnome to take on your road trip and then return the gnome with photos?
Yeah and also, many people don't know there's really no correlation between connection quality and service bars either. To answer your question, I'm not sure. What does Minnie Mouse stand for?
I guess he's not the lowest key Prime Minister you could get. I guess many politicians get in the news for unflattering circumstances now and then.
I do as well! Were you a subscriber even back when their whole business model was about DVD rental by mail and not an online platform?
I do too, I don't particularly like him. Did you vote last election
Hey how is it going, you ever cook a turkey during Thanksgiving?
That is amazing. Have you seen the movie Blazing Saddles?
I know, I haven't seen it. How lucky to find baseball cards in your grandfathers attic worth 3 million dollars! Good chat!!
Yeah I guess talent runs in the family. Do you now how many hours of video games we play in a week as a planet?
They are indeed very smart and that proves it. Nice chatting with you.
True! Do you ever Listen to Taylor Swift?
I did, but I rather watch the games than to play them on a video game console, do you like baseball?
Have you ever played the game yourself, I have not, I'm not originally from the US.
Me too! But, we still can watch it being played. Who's your favorite player?
That's unusual, I've never thought of heavy metal as literature, but ok. Who's your favorite author?
That's really cool that you seem to be in good spirits about it, much like the little boy. I guess an event like that can really change your overall perspective.
Then maybe you could try the deaf rapper, Signmark. He rhymes in sign language! You don't have to listen at all! I'm going to go try to find some on the internet. Goodbye!
Those pucks look dangerous flying around.  I understand that most other countries understand hockey to mean field hockey.  I guess it depend on if your country is cold or not.
Yeah that's horrible! interesting that the term "robotic" was created by a science fiction author, you'd think that it would have been an actual science term, and this happened back in 1941 haha
I didnt, he has a great voice! you know that Stephen Fry is also a game narrator, he narrater the voice for some games
Yeah, too bad for them. Do you like comedy?
I wonder if someone was fired at fox because of George Lucas deal. Anyway, I've got to run. Nice chatting with you.
Hi did you ever play with Nintendo?
Not any more but I used to.  I do like knowing that in Norway the government will buy copies your book that you publish and put them in libraries.  It sounds like they really support their libraries.
Good, yourself? do you listen to music?
I think so too.  Well, my wife is asking me to go get some whipping cream for some chicken soup so I am going to wrap it up.  Nice chatting with you.
That guy was everywhere. Did you ever watch wall-e?
I have. I heard that he started a library in 1895 with 32,000 books in it. All from his personal collection. Can you imagine?
Talented guy, what are your thoughts on the goatees some of the pleyers grow?
I do watch basketball on occasion. Which is your favorite team?
Do you like Leonardo DiCaprio? He got his start in the 1980's sitcom Growing Pains...
Is her name Anne Jones ? If yes you could put a generator on your books and sell the electricity. Do you enjoy reading ?
