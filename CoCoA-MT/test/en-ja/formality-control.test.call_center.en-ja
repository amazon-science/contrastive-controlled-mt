He's not answering the mic. I'm pressing on me. I'm at the office. My guys are out there pressing the button. They're whooping and hollering over the
Okay, is this going to take long, because I got my kids to pick up from school?

I am putting through that CVV number on my pad and I, okay, yes, it's done. Now, you can proceed.
Hi, Alex. This is Amy Bush. I actually need to make travel arrangements to Sacramento, for a high profile client of mine. So it's very important for me to
Yep, that is correct. That's my number.
When would I be given a bassinet?
Oh, Porto Le Grando? Yeah. That must've been me. Are you excited?
Is there anything else that I should be aware of, as far as children policy?
If a member of my family is taken ill and no longer wishes to travel due to this, I'm entitled for a refund?
Alright, so I'm putting that CVV number onto my dial-pad and yup, there you go, go ahead and please proceed.
Yes, I was, I had a blocked artery and I was exerting myself when shoveling gravel. It was very heavy and I had to go to the emergency room with my son and my daughter.
So, what are you telling me, son? You're telling me that I need the purchase order separately or what?
And please provide me a good valid email address. That way, once we're done making the reservation for the smoking room, I can tell you the confirmation via that way.

No. This is the first time I'm taking a loan.
Okay, okay, that does sound good, like I said. And just another quick question, I was wondering, what about the hotels during this trip?
Let me tell you that a fee of fifty dollars is to be paid towards the same thing due to limited inventory for accommodating infants per fly.
My email is at the time not valid and not working, and I prefer not to give it out.
Yeah, Joey, about that, I don't really feel very comfortable giving out all those details, cause I had a problem a couple months ago with that. I gave out my information to this
So, I have to stress this out. It's very important for me to be in a single and non-smoking room, please.
So the room is booked. I got a message the amount was already deducted from the bank, so I basically already have it booked and I have nothing to worry about. I arrive at the airport
What happened is that I gave out my information to this insurance company, and they just gave the information to a third party which then went on and sold the information somewhere else I guess.
Thanks for giving me the detailed information.
Okay. I have a requirement but I want to know some other information. I would like to know what is the actual rate of interest for this?
Oh, it should be Peter, my name.
Wow! That does sound really good. So let's see. I think I'm going to book the suite for me and my request is I would like to have meals served

I don't know, is there any way that we could like move it out so that I can order faster?
Let me go ahead. And you need my account number or my mobile number or something like that?
Alright, what are the check-in times of the room and I might need early check-in as well, because we're arriving a little bit earlier than when we're supposed to.
Okay, perfect. It's not a big deal. We're still in the process of moving, so it doesn't really matter. But yeah, okay, I will just keep an eye out for it, I guess.
Yes, of course, this is going to be under my name, that will be Tom Brady.
So I want to pay a lot.
The first name is John and the last name is Margaretta. So I'm going to go ahead and repeat it again, it's John Margaretta, okay?
Please confirm me the rate as well, since I have some other business to take care of.
And how can I locate the store details of payback partners?
And if you guys have a shuttle, you know, if that's free, that would be great. It would save me some money. But yes, I will need early check-in.
