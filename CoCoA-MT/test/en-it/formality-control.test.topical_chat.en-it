I think that in a foxhole,your motivation to succeed would be pretty high. Try that and see what happens. LOL
That's true with Walmart. But with Prime you get music and videos free. Books too for your Kindle. I stream videos, so this is a good benefit. I shop other places occasionally-like Etsy for gifts.

It doesnt roll off the tongue at all lol its ridiculous,  you cant even say it fast.
I think its a really long and boring name lol, I do like to play video games as well do you have a PlayStation system?

That's very strange indeed.  Well it's been nice chatting with you this afternoon.  Hope you enjoy the rest of your day, friend.
What do you think about the United Nations appointing an ambassador to extraterrestrials? I wonder what he does all day, sounds like the most boring job in the world because obviously we haven't had contact yet

Looked very cool, when he did it! I heard somewhere that Tupac danced ballet. Have you heard anything about that?
True! Do you ever Listen to Taylor Swift?
he had notoriety to launch a campaign. if you are rich, famous, tall, etc you can run for govt. i figure the future is all about marketing, not content.
It is really nice of him. What do you think about Glenn Howerton? He actually was the star of Always Sunny in Philadelphia and he almost got the lead in Jurassic World

I wonder how that banning action would fare in today's world and society, you think it would receive negative press?
Yeah that is so lame to me. If you don't like it, then you learn your lesson and don't buy any more tickets to any more concerts.

I haven't seen it, but I'll take your word for it.
wow. I never cared for her books, did you?
Nice me too! I never heard of that, that would be awesome, do you use your own car or a cart?
When you buy a product, you get something in return. If you do not buy something, like facebook, youare the product. They are selling you to others through your data or ads.
Stan lee is excellent writer also, he make the movie interesting. Which is your favourite sports ?
The train is moving. you are moving. you are moving at the same speed. if you jump up, your speed does not change. if it turns and you dont, then you will slam into the wall.

Well, your dog can't help. I would the chips off the floor too! They're CHIPS. Can't go to waste.
I think it would remove all pleasure from life. Food? Beer? Wine? What would you do with all your time?

Yeah, Hey listen to this it's illegal in south africa to equip a flame-thrower to your car to prevent carjacking.

i agree with you. it happened several years ago. it says pro-trumpers found them and posted them to social media. that seems odd...
What did you think of the last couple elections?
No worries.   Perhaps Eddie Van Halen is more your speed?  He played on "Beat It!"
That is kind of cool. Speaking of cool, do you think Ugg boots are cool? They were invented by surfers to keep their feet warm after getting out of the water.
Yeah that is true. Do you use your phone much?
You sound like me! I have been to so many concerts and have bought so much music over the years. I have  alot to refer back to. Do you have favorite bands?
Yeah. Can't be too hurried while your life is on the line or it will take too long.
I agree with you! Especially with the box office at what it is. I would hate to work for the movie Trojan Wars. They made only 309 dollars on a budget of 15 million!
